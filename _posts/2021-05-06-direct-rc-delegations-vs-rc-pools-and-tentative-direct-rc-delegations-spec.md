title: "Direct RC delegations vs RC pools and tentative direct rc delegations spec"
description: "First let's settle on the terms, when I say "RC pools", it refers to the implementation where everyone can delegate to pools and then pools can delegate to users, with more notions like overdelegation (you can delegate more RC than there is available in the pool) etc, we'll get back to it later."
