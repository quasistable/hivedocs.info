title: "How To Setup Hive Witness Pricefeed Using Hivefeed-JS"
description: "Setting up a pricefeed is quite a simple task to do yet so many witnesses don't do it. I use it as one of my basic qualifiers on who I'll vote for a witness(if yours isn't updated in 3.5 days, no chance of getting my witness vote). It's a very basic thing to do and its just a quick and easy way to see how much a witness is paying attention to their own witness."
