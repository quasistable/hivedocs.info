There has been much confusion about the various lists available on Hive.  This post is meant to answer some of your questions to that regard. Please feel free to ask more questions as you see fit. 

# Decentralized blacklists and mutelists
These are on-chain lists based on the 'follow' function, which allows you to interact by either choosing to view in prominence or to hide from view the posts of another account. 

Any user can create a list or subscribe to an existing list that someone else created. When subscribed or created, the list will govern which accounts the user will not see. This is currently widely used for phishing accounts. 

- List is for limiting interaction with accounts on it
- Users and projects are able to create a coherent list of undesirable accounts (in their opinion)
- Subscribers can limit what they themselves can see and keep their experienced focused
- Lists mainly affect the frontend user experience 
- Lists do not have any effect on reward distribution

# Spaminator blacklist
The Spaminator blacklist is for accounts that are involved in **exploitation** on Hive. This is usually directly related to the exploitation of the reward pool. The Spaminator bot works off a ledger of account names, the on-chain interactions of which it logs into its database as it streams the blockchain. 

- A hands-off bot written in Python 
- 76955 accounts on it right now
- 1012 different account groups (grouped for classification purposes) of which many are different botnets
- Very, very few users on it are unique individuals; most are exploitation accounts
- No appeal timer, prompt removal is possible
- No maximum amount of strikes for unique individuals

Only active accounts are logged and are given a warning downvote. Where they are a unique individual, they will come and reply in some way. The unique individuals are usually victims of hacking/phishing or of other scams against them. They are warned through the bot and are helped to recover. 


# Hivewatchers Banlist
What is commonly referred to as the 'Hivewatchers blacklist' is actually a 'banlist'. We are not sure on how this name originally came about as we inherited the project and it's list but that's its official name. 

Hivewatchers is focused on **fraud**. Fraud can be defined as ID theft/deception, plagiarism (of all types), and generally fraudulent activities of various types. 

- Not part of Spaminator
- Used to educate users and give them a chance to be removed
- Only for unique individual accounts 
- Not used for botnets unless the botnet is based on deception
- Has a timer that gets activated for removal after an appeal starts
- A maximum two strikes and no more appeals are possible for unique individuals

# Mutelist vs Spaminator vs Hivewatchers

Because of the words 'list' and 'blacklist' there are many points of confusion around their differences and similarities. 

Stored centrally | Mutelist | Spaminator | Hivewatchers |
-|-|-|-|
Stored centrally in database | No | Yes | Yes |
Created by specific entity | Yes | Yes | Yes |
Limits interaction | Yes | No | No |
Frontend-focused | Yes | No | Yes |
Mandatory for users | No | No | No |
Automatically restores rewards | No | Yes | No |
Downvotes to warn | No | Yes | Yes |
Upvotes to warn | No | No | No |
Scope is set by default | No | Yes | Yes |
Hides post | Yes | No | No |
Is a hands-off bot | No | Yes | Both |
Is a feature | Yes | No | No |
On-chain controls | Yes | No | Yes |

# Outdated Terminology: 'Spam' 
The word 'Spam' is being phased out because of several issues:
- Too overused, vague and unclear
- Commonly used to mislabel and thus downgrade major threats such as phishing that require urgency
- Is often found attributed to everything irrespective of scope by users
- Is used to label low-effort content, shorter content, content that is disliked by the user, content in languages that don't always properly display, etc. 

The most predominant issue is phishing. When phishing becomes mislabeled as spam, the person being warned to either seek help recovering their account or to not click on a malicious link does not understand the severity of the matter. All phishing should always be referred to as 'phishing'. 

The word 'spam' is actively being removed from Hivewatchers comments and we are currently in transition to that regard. 

# Hive.Blog Mutelist
This list is used for phishing/hacked accounts predominantly, with a few accounts spreading malware thrown in. It is a great list to follow by default and is also replicated in the [Plenty of Phish repository](https://github.com/gryter/plentyofphish/blob/master/phishing.txt), on Spaminator and several other places. Once an account is recovered and is safe, it is removed from the list. 

This is one example of a Mutelist being used effectively and for a concrete purpose that warrants subscription and benefits all users irrespective of their beliefs, outlook, or anything else. It is strongly recommended that everyone takes all possible measures to prevent supporting hackers or falling prey to them.

# FAQ

**So why can't Spaminator just use a decentralized list? I still don't understand.**
Spaminator is a bot and needs its data in a local ledger (on its servers) to function. It was made to purely read the chain (it streams the blocks) and constantly querying on-chain lists would put a huge load on the endpoints quite unnecessarily. Additionally, it has about 76k account on it, many of which are massive botnets and not individual users. They are listed in their respective categories and managed through our servers. Adding them to one massive on-chain list is just not practical. 

**Will there be a Hivewatchers decentralized on-chain Mutelist or Blacklist?**
Yes. The Hivewatchers list is quite short in comparison to Spaminator and is meant to focus on fraud, as we already discussed. We'll have an announcement to that regard. We will likely end up with two lists on Hivewatchers; one for accounts that are permanently on and one for those that have a chance to appeal or are appealing. 

**Do you recommend I follow the Hivewatchers list and set my account to automatically downvote everything on it?**
We ask that you keep yourself safe. Some of the accounts we deal with belong to individuals who are extremely dangerous, are known for targeted harassment, death threats, stalking, doxxing, and other similar activities. Use your personal discretion.

**Are all accounts granted appeals?**
No. ID thieves, exploitation ring operators, hackers/phishers, or systemic repeat fraudsters are not granted further consideration. There is a limit to our 'revolving door'. Repeatedly having the same accounts mislead the community in their appeals is damaging to Hive. 

**My account is both on Hivewatchers and Spaminator. Why?**
In cases where there is fraud coupled with exploitation of the blockchain and its reward mechanism, the account may fit both scopes. If the account is part of a botnet or an organized ring, then it will likely be on both.

**Is short-form content allowed on Hive?**
All content is treated the same way: It should be at least 50% original to have some value and anything taken from the internet should be clearly cited. Short-form content doesn't mean that suddenly there is free reign to copy/paste other people's work and make money off it. It is never acceptable to steal from others for personal profit.

**I tried to use the on-chain Mutelist/Blacklist feature and I discovered bugs or issues. What do I do?**
The decentralized list feature is still being developed. Please submit your bugs/issues to https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser

**Should I report hacking/phishing, even if it's not on chain but still related to the Hive ecosystem in general?**
Yes. Please contact @guiltyparties and outline what happened. Even if your dapp got hacked please advise. 

**I hate Hivewatchers and Spaminator and want to disrupt all activities, so I'm upvoting everything Spaminator downvotes.**
If you've decided that scammers should be rewarded, we ask you to still please ensure that you are not supporting those who hack and phish other people's accounts. Just reach out to @guiltyparties on Openhive.chat or Discord and I'll set you up with the appropriate lists to exclude from your 'curation'.  It's not an all or nothing deal. If you are supporting phishing you will be treated the same as the hackers themselves.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

This is a version bump and should not adversely affect existing applications that use the `hive-ruby` gem.  Changes are focused on performance improvements to `Hive::Stream` subroutines.

The main change is that we no longer have to rely on `json-rpc-batch` to stream blocks.  Prior to this change, if the API node supported batched requests, it would ask for up to 50 blocks using [this published standard](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch).

But not all API endpoints supported the standard.  In HF24, we got the [`block_api.get_block_range`](https://developers.hive.io/apidefinitions/#block_api.get_block_range) method.  And although not all endpoints support this method, it's much more supported than `json-rpc-batch`.

Hive Ruby will try whatever the endpoint will provide, starting with `get_block_range`, then `json-rpc-batch`, and then just fall back on non-batched requests.

In addition to this new method, if you area streaming virtual operations, Hive Ruby will now use [`account_history_api.enum_virtual_ops`](https://developers.hive.io/apidefinitions/#account_history_api.enum_virtual_ops) (if supported).  This will improve performance and reliability, even when streaming virtual operations from the head block.

&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>inertia</name></author><category term="news" /><category term="ruby" /><summary type="html">This is a version bump and should not adversely affect existing applications that use the `hive-ruby` gem. Changes are focused on performance improvements to `Hive::Stream` subroutines. The main change is that we no longer have to rely on `json-rpc-batch` to stream blocks. Prior to this change, if the API node supported batched requests, it would ask for up to 50 blocks using [this published standard](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch). But not all API endpoints supported the standard. In HF24, we got the [`block_api.get_block_range`](https://developers.hive.io/apidefinitions/#block_api.get_block_range) method. And although not all endpoints support this method, it's much more supported than `json-rpc-batch`. Hive Ruby will try whatever the endpoint will provide, starting with `get_block_range`, then `json-rpc-batch`, and then just fall back on non-batched requests. In addition to this new method, if you area streaming virtual operations, Hive Ruby will now use [`account_history_api.enum_virtual_ops`](https://developers.hive.io/apidefinitions/#account_history_api.enum_virtual_ops) (if supported). This will improve performance and reliability, even when streaming virtual operations from the head block. See rev.: [94142bc]( https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive-ruby/-/commit/94142bc9b21a662ce8f467c60f1e039a7e62d832) To update your application: ```bash bundle update hive-ruby ``` See previous `hive-ruby` posts: [peakd.com/c/hive-139531/search?q=hive-ruby](https://peakd.com/c/hive-139531/search?q=hive-ruby) See: Ruby Client for Hive: hive-ruby-1.0.3 by @inertia</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/inertia/aJnQFjOw-logo-128.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/inertia/aJnQFjOw-logo-128.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">My new contributions to the Hive Condenser and Wallet apps.</title><link href="https://hivedocs.info/news/nodejs/condenser/2021/04/22/6cv6sw-my-new-contributions-to-the-hive-condenser-and-wallet-apps.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My new contributions to the Hive Condenser and Wallet apps." /><published>2021-04-22T05:59:18-07:00</published><updated>2021-04-22T05:59:18-07:00</updated><id>https://hivedocs.info/news/nodejs/condenser/2021/04/22/6cv6sw-my-new-contributions-to-the-hive-condenser-and-wallet-apps</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hivedocs.info/news/nodejs/condenser/2021/04/22/6cv6sw-my-new-contributions-to-the-hive-condenser-and-wallet-apps.html">&lt;div id=&quot;content-quochuy-6cv6sw-my-new-contributions-to-the-hive-condenser-and-wallet-apps&quot;&gt;## Context
I have been involved (voluntarily) with the development of the Condenser &amp;amp; Wallet apps (that are powering https://hive.blog and https://wallet.hive.blog) for quite a while now. There are other great frontends to Hive out there such as https://peakd.com and https://ecency.com but I have always been more or less faithful with the Condenser.

This is a regular report on my new contributions. Some of the new work below might still be in test and not yet deployed.

## Add highlight syntax to code blocks in blog posts
There was [a request for syntax highlighting](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/issues/115) on posts. We indeed have some developers sharing code on the platform. So I tested integrating PrismJS and HighlightJS. I picked HighlightJS due to the way it works nicely with the Condenser.

However, there were some concerns that HighlightJS package is 270KB+ which might be a problem for mobile phone users on a slow bandwidth. So this change might not get approved for deployment to production. See my next contribution below instead.

Merge request: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/merge_requests/234

## Supporting GitHub's GIST embeds
@good-karma suggested that instead of highlighting syntax, we could simply add support for [GIST](http://gist.github.com/) embedded views. [GIST is a tool allowing you to share code snippets or data excerpts](http://gist.github.com/). It also has syntax highlighting so integrating it to the Condenser is lightweight.

There is one downside to the method though: old posts not using GIST won't have their code highlighted.

Thank you @mahdiyari for helping with testing

## Display votes value breakdown
Aren't you sometimes curious as to what is the $ contribution of a vote on your post? This little change adds vote value to the voter list of a post.

The first version of our in-App browser is ready for testing, on both TestFlight (iOS) and Google Play as version 1.1.0.

This new version adds a browser tab to the Keychain menu, on which users can have the same Keychain experience as on their desktop browser. Testers, please update your App to 1.1.0 to test this new feature. If you wish to try it but are not on our tester list yet, join us on Discord (see below) and drop a message in the join-testers channel.
 
Although it's not complete yet, the most widely used operations are all included and ready to get tested:

- Login methods 
- Generic broadcasts
- Post / Comment
- Vote
- Transfer (with or without encrypted memo)
- Hive Engine Transfer
- Power up / down
- Delegations
- Proposal votes
- Witness vote / proxy
- Encode / Decode message
- Sign transaction / buffer

Please don't hesitate to open issue on [our Github](https://github.com/stoodkev/hive-keychain-mobile/issues).

Future improvements for the in-App browser that are already on the roadmap for the next update include:
- Adding missing requests
- Handle browser history
- Url autocomplete
- Handling multiple browser tabs
- Bookmarking 
- Automatically accept posting authority requests if whitelisted (similar to the browser extension)

1. This is a first release and the Application is still in Beta. It has been tested extensively but it should not by any means be the only place you store your keys on.
2. To import accounts quickly from your Hive Keychain extension to your mobile App, use the QR Code scanner by pressing the QR code logo:

On your extension, navigate to the menu (top right button), then to `Manage Accounts` and finally click on `Show QR Code`.

One of the tools I maintain is Tin Toy.  It's a docker image for running a tiny Hive testnet on your local computer.

With it, you can point your application and test new functionality, without having to broadcast to the mainnet.

I just did a refresh on the `develop` branch so you can try out the next hardfork, HF25.

It's also a tool that comes in handy for me, when I'm doing [documentation](https://peakd.com/c/hive-139531/search?q=devportal), because it helps me find new functionality and create tutorials.  You'll find that anytime the devportal mentions a testnet, it's going to recommend tintoy.  And so for this reason, I feel like this is time well spent when researching and improving the devportal.

To try out the hived 1.26.0, right now:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8090:8090 inertia/tintoy:develop
```

Then point your app API endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

--- 

Tin Toy - A tiny Hive testnet based on [tinman](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/tinman)

# Quickstart

```bash
docker run -d -p 8090:8090 inertia/tintoy:latest
```

Using `-p 8090:8090` will expose json-rpc.

... or ...

```bash
docker run -d -P inertia/tintoy:latest
```

Using `-P` will expose all of the ports, ephemerally (see below).

If you want to modify the scripts before deploying:

```bash
git clone https://gist.github.com/b88e7bfff8862858e54c59392e2bce20.git tintoy
cd tintoy
docker build -t myname/tintoy:mybranch .
docker run -d -P myname/tintoy:mybranch
```

For example, you can modify the first line of `Dockerfile` to switch versions of `hived`.

Tin Toy uses:

```Dockerfile
FROM hiveio/hive:latest
```

But you can switch to any branch and try it out.  Suggested branches to try can be found in [hive/activity](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/activity).

Say we want to take a look at a branch like `develop`.  Change the first line of the `Dockerfile` to:

```Dockerfile
FROM hiveio/hive:develop
```

Then build and run.

# Shell In

* Use `docker ps` to get the name of the existing container.
* Use the command `docker exec -it &lt;container name=&quot;&quot;&gt; /bin/bash` to get a bash shell in the container.

# How to Use

Once the docker container has fully deployed, you'll have access to various port.  Internally, the docker container responds to:

| Port | Purpose   |
|------|-----------|
| 2001 | p2p       |
| 8090 | jussi json-rpc |
| 8091 | hived json-rpc |
| 8092 | hivemind json-rpc |
| 5000 | tinman server (if enabled) |

If you launched with `-P` (ephemeral ports enabled), you can get a list of ports:

```bash
docker ps
```

Which might return something like:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                                                NAMES
290810dba18e        inertia/tintoy:latest   &quot;/bin/sh -c /app/boo…&quot;   5 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes        0.0.0.0:32832-&amp;gt;2001/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32831-&amp;gt;8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32830-&amp;gt;8090/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32829-&amp;gt;8091/tcp   tintoy
```

## Default Secret Key

Normally, the secret key for a testnet is kept secret.  But for a local testnet, there's no reason to keep it a secret.  For tintoy, the default secret key is set in the `Dockerfile`:

```bash
ENV SHARED_SECRET tintoy
```

Which means, if you want to derive the private keys for `tnman`, you could use the following command:

```bash
get_dev_key tintoy owner-tnman active-tnman posting-tnman memo-tnman | jq
```

```json
[
  {
    &quot;private_key&quot;: &quot;5K5kjWq8pY23YptZaiEkiiaKi1wafufj63nzAtaDu1epVXw9fvz&quot;,
    &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;TST7uubH7SpknapasQTzW1rFho3LUn1pFmdR7X4f1cHmK22aTJYm3&quot;,
    &quot;account_name&quot;: &quot;owner-tnman&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;private_key&quot;: &quot;5K3NwkFwCnsSfJNACw1qm3zzojWBtP8k4rTb2kbLQ4DDR6TgGnw&quot;,
    &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;TST4w9GXogQtqPprzPhp7WKZPPKWXv4KvqqMMgd5agJQCDtYLBJwA&quot;,
    &quot;account_name&quot;: &quot;active-tnman&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;private_key&quot;: &quot;5Jrdrbt5xfjVeHfHd5JMiJy1FfrGtuieRvzr9WFYhcdHpjgfwPY&quot;,
    &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;TST883nSqJL5KbVgfdV44snPPDTStQQxfR7vj8XttsZo25sXvHAnQ&quot;,
    &quot;account_name&quot;: &quot;posting-tnman&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;private_key&quot;: &quot;5KB3ddeh5o3WghSM3qQaUthxVt7QZWfNYCoiAW3XYfeDki1oH9z&quot;,
    &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;TST56jtUgZrajuBUgdECYaew6cebjSbKWVdtCKkc4xxLAFZQ9f8A9&quot;,
    &quot;account_name&quot;: &quot;memo-tnman&quot;
  }
]
```

Every account on the testnet uses `tnman` as their account authority.  Using this account, you can sign any transaction for any account.

## Snapshot Refresh

Occasionally, it's a good idea to refresh the `sample-snapshot.json` file.  This process is usually only required to be performed by the repo maintainer, but if you want to do it yourself, here are the steps:

1. Install `tinman` by following that product's [README.md](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/tinman#installation).
2. Next, [generate a new snapshot](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/tinman#taking-a-snapshot).
  * Example: `tinman snapshot -s https://anyx.io -o - | pv &amp;gt; snapshot.json`
3. Once we have our new snapshot, create a sample, overwriting the previous one.
  * Example: `tinman sample -i snapshot.json -o sample-snapshot.json`
4. Delete (or move) `snapshot.json` (we don't need it anymore now that we have `sample-snapshot.json`).

# meeting tl;dr:

## Dev sync

As usual it's better to listen to this part

## RC delegations

@blocktrades and team are concerned about some design decisions (operations in a non consensus plugin), after some offline discussions we realized that it was fine, we were just not aligned on semantics. 

Then there are some memory concerns (a lot of new data is stored). I will be running some tests this week to build a million delegations and see the memory impact it would have on nodes, it shouldn't cost more than a extra gig of ram. So I'll be building a test to monitor this. 

Also while we were discussing offline, we realized that rc delegates were non consensus meaning that it could be rolled out without a hard fork, and ultimately decided to push them to hf25.1, the reasoning being that there is no reason to risk the health of the chain making a big release when we can release hf25 and then a bit later release hf25.1 with rc delegations. I know it will come as a disapointment to some, but one of the core principles of the dev team is risk averse and if we can avoid a risk / spread it over multiple smaller releases, we will do it.

## Incoming rc delegations index

Us implementing the index or not will depend on the result from the memory cost of the rc plugin, but it may have to be done via L2

## Increase custom json operation limit per block

Would be a problem as we go into the middle of 2021 with a lot of applications relying on it, it's actually not a problem, as the limit is &quot;per account per block&quot; and not &quot;per block&quot;. 

## Testnet setup + date (?) + bug bounty ?

Testnet will be setup by voluntary witnesses (most likely myself), date is still kinda undetermined, but could be as early as the end of the week, the &quot;human&quot; cost of organizing a bug bounty was deemed to big compared to the benefits it brings.

## HiveStem hackathon on core dev things ?

We figured that it would be interesting to let people hack on hivemind, so I will be creating a guide on how to setup a dev hivemind environment so participants can participate on it if they want (things like communities, sorting algorithms etc) 

## Test another platform like jitsi and stop paying zoom fees

We'll need to see with @roelandp who currently pays for the account and @crimsonclad who manages the stream but we are inclined to use any platform really.

## Move the meeting ahead by a few hours

There is a bit of wiggle room (1/2 hours early, an hour after), we'll run a poll with current regular participants to see what would fit them best.

## soft cap in hf25 or hf26

https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/issues/140 we will roll out a fix on hf25, it's a very small change but an important one for hive -&amp;gt; hbd conversions.

## from @guiltyparties: 
`Review of open issues on gitlab (who, when, ...). Some are 1 year old.`
```
The possibility for authors/dapps to set a) max accepted rewards to author AND b) max accepted rewards to curator ---- both values required or set to default. Usecase: dapp wants to limit rewards for posts through it to 1$ for authors but to $10 for curators.
```

I think it would be possible to get close to that output via beneficiaries and max payout, I can't remember if curation rewards are before or after beneficiaries (before would make more sense) so let's say you want 1$ to the author and 10$ to curators, you can set the max reward to 20$, and a 90% beneficiary to @null, that way when it's computed you get:

50% of the reward goes to curators = 10$, out of the remaining 10$ for the author 9$ goes to @null, and 1$ goes to the author. 

Something to play around with, but I think this can be done purely using the existing chain functionalities.

##  from @arcange:

`Review of open issues on gitlab (who, when, ...). Some are 1 year old.` 

Some discussion regarding on who's responsibility it falls to follow up with open tickets and who should close tickets, better to listen to this part. 

Then we reviewed and closed https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/issues/61 and https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/issues/14

Then there are some memory concerns (a lot of new data is stored). I will be running some tests this week to build a million delegations and see the memory impact it would have on nodes, it shouldn't cost more than a extra gig of ram. So I'll be building a test to monitor this. Also while we were discussing offline, we realized that rc delegates were non consensus meaning that it could be rolled out without a hard fork, and ultimately decided to push them to hf25.1, the reasoning being that there is no reason to risk the health of the chain making a big release when we can release hf25 and then a bit later release hf25.1 with rc delegations. I know it will come as a disapointment to some, but one of the core principles of the dev team is risk averse and if we can avoid a risk / spread it over multiple smaller releases, we will do it. ## Incoming rc delegations index Us implementing the index or not will depend on the result from the memory cost of the rc plugin, but it may have to be done via L2 ## Increase custom json operation limit per block Would be a problem as we go into the middle of 2021 with a lot of applications relying on it, it's actually not a problem, as the limit is &quot;per account per block&quot; and not &quot;per block&quot;. ## Testnet setup + date (?) + bug bounty ? Testnet will be setup by voluntary witnesses (most likely myself), date is still kinda undetermined, but could be as early as the end of the week, the &quot;human&quot; cost of organizing a bug bounty was deemed to big compared to the benefits it brings. ## HiveStem hackathon on core dev things ? We figured that it would be interesting to let people hack on hivemind, so I will be creating a guide on how to setup a dev hivemind environment so participants can participate on it if they want (things like communities, sorting algorithms etc) ## Test another platform like jitsi and stop paying zoom fees We'll need to see with @roelandp who currently pays for the account and @crimsonclad who manages the stream but we are inclined to use any platform really. ## Move the meeting ahead by a few hours There is a bit of wiggle room (1/2 hours early, an hour after), we'll run a poll with current regular participants to see what would fit them best. ## soft cap in hf25 or hf26 https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/issues/140 we will roll out a fix on hf25, it's a very small change but an important one for hive -&amp;gt; hbd conversions. ## from @guiltyparties: `Review of open issues on gitlab (who, when, ...). Some are 1 year old.` ``` The possibility for authors/dapps to set a) max accepted rewards to author AND b) max accepted rewards to curator ---- both values required or set to default. Usecase: dapp wants to limit rewards for posts through it to 1$ for authors but to $10 for curators. ``` I think it would be possible to get close to that output via beneficiaries and max payout, I can't remember if curation rewards are before or after beneficiaries (before would make more sense) so let's say you want 1$ to the author and 10$ to curators, you can set the max reward to 20$, and a 90% beneficiary to @null, that way when it's computed you get: 50% of the reward goes to curators = 10$, out of the remaining 10$ for the author 9$ goes to @null, and 1$ goes to the author. Something to play around with, but I think this can be done purely using the existing chain functionalities. ## from @arcange: `Review of open issues on gitlab (who, when, ...). Some are 1 year old.` Some discussion regarding on who's responsibility it falls to follow up with open tickets and who should close tickets, better to listen to this part. Then we reviewed and closed https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/issues/61 and https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/issues/14 # Support what I'm doing If you like what I'm doing, please consider voting on my new proposal: https://peakd.com/proposals/167 [hivesigner](https://hivesigner.com/import?redirect=%2Fsign%2Fupdate-proposal-votes%3Fproposal_ids%3D%255B167%255D%26approve%3Dtrue&amp;amp;authority=active) See: Hive core developer meeting #21 by @howo</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/2tOH_yCANCo/0.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/2tOH_yCANCo/0.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">My new contributions to the Hive Condenser and Wallet apps.</title><link href="https://hivedocs.info/news/nodejs/condenser/2021/04/13/5ps1ah-my-new-contributions-to-the-hive-condenser-and-wallet-apps.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My new contributions to the Hive Condenser and Wallet apps." /><published>2021-04-13T00:27:24-07:00</published><updated>2021-04-13T00:27:24-07:00</updated><id>https://hivedocs.info/news/nodejs/condenser/2021/04/13/5ps1ah-my-new-contributions-to-the-hive-condenser-and-wallet-apps</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hivedocs.info/news/nodejs/condenser/2021/04/13/5ps1ah-my-new-contributions-to-the-hive-condenser-and-wallet-apps.html">&lt;div id=&quot;content-quochuy-5ps1ah-my-new-contributions-to-the-hive-condenser-and-wallet-apps&quot;&gt;## Context
I have been involved (voluntarily) with the development of the Condenser &amp;amp; Wallet apps (that are powering https://hive.blog and https://wallet.hive.blog) for quite a while now. There are other great frontends to Hive out there such as https://peakd.com and https://ecency.com but I have always been more or less faithful with the Condenser.

This is a regular report on my new contributions. Some of the new work below might still be in test and not yet deployed.

## Sanitize input fields
I noticed that when creating a new community, users were allowed to use HTML code. Although the HTML is not interpreted it is still displayed (encoded) on the screen which looks bad. Apparently, there is no sanitising code of user input for those fields. This code change adds input sanitisation at creation and content filtering at display to clean up existing data.

Merge request: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/merge_requests/232

## Modifying the community selection on post creation
Myself and other users have often accidentally posted our content in the wrong community because we forgot to select the right one when creating the post. Currently the community selection process is not very obvious. For this change what I've done is:
- create an actually community selector drop down menu in the post editing form
- move it to the bottom right next to the `Post` button

![Community selector](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/uploads/2c64f4229ba3743c83cf0afcb37f9d91/Screen_Shot_2021-04-09_at_4.51.17_pm.jpg)

To change community, you don't have to go back to browse through them anymore, the menu should make it easier.

### Footnote

I know that some people are not impressed by the design of Hive.io. And that's fine. Still, looking back, I'm somewhat proud that I was able to create it in a span of days under pressure for it to be ready for Launch on March 25th 2020. (this ofc. goes for **everyone** who collaborated in the launch) Especially considering that I had to come up with a theme and sexy catchphrase.

&amp;gt; Fast.
&amp;gt; Scalable.
&amp;gt; Powerful.
&amp;gt; The Blockchain for Web 3.0

![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/therealwolf/EoibUABQD1YoMsK3va1ySF1QjsorKyh42LGaUJX8PXimvyhKK4brFCX84BoycGetQpU.png)

Now, I'm not sure whether it's actually the best way to describe Hive, considering that tech will always advance and Hive lacks behind in some aspects, and our most powerful attribute/strength is the tight-knit community. So maybe it's time for some change.

Since the website is owned by the community, you can simply submit ideas yourself on Gitlab: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive-io. Or if that's too troublesome, just comment below. This goes for everything on the website ofc.

Note: I'm not hosting hive.io nor am I &quot;in charge&quot; of Hive. Just a community developer.

And that's fine. Still, looking back, I'm somewhat proud that I was able to create it in a span of days under pressure for it to be ready for Launch on March 25th 2020. (this ofc. goes for **everyone** who collaborated in the launch) Especially considering that I had to come up with a theme and sexy catchphrase. &amp;gt; Fast. &amp;gt; Scalable. &amp;gt; Powerful. &amp;gt; The Blockchain for Web 3.0 ![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/therealwolf/EoibUABQD1YoMsK3va1ySF1QjsorKyh42LGaUJX8PXimvyhKK4brFCX84BoycGetQpU.png) Now, I'm not sure whether it's actually the best way to describe Hive, considering that tech will always advance and Hive lacks behind in some aspects, and our most powerful attribute/strength is the tight-knit community. So maybe it's time for some change. Since the website is owned by the community, you can simply submit ideas yourself on Gitlab: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive-io. Or if that's too troublesome, just comment below. This goes for everything on the website ofc. Note: I'm not hosting hive.io nor am I &quot;in charge&quot; of Hive. Just a community developer.

#### Preface

This tutorial assumes that you have a server with hived installed and synced. As well as a server capable of running [Hivemind](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind). (preferably Ubuntu 20.04)

If you would like to run a production environment Hivemind, please run a docker container. It is a lot easier to set up and the potential of something going wrong is a lot less than manual setup. (Also recommended)

#### Getting Started

First of all, you would need to install PostgreSQL 12, since that is what we're using for Hivemind at the moment, as well as the main requirements for Hivemind.

`apt install postgresql git python3 python3-dev build-essential libpq-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libffi-dev`

After the installation is complete, you will need to go into postgres. (This is similar to MySQL -uroot)

`sudo -u postgres psql`

then, create the database user.

`create user hive with password 'hive';`


![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/deathwing/23tRxJBSsvGs8kKGcrU1f7twSivSfs2bybmpEHkRHNHKcxhEuQf7g8byrCoxdzoremfnC.png)

Next step, create the database.

`create database hive;`


![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/deathwing/23tkjayTiHw8sVBiXwXn72naK4FB3DfoVXehYyHvZa6MTPiMDzmjfEWKRcJM7Sqv7KVak.png)


By default, a database is owned by user `postgres` you will need to change this to the user that you will be using for your Hivemind instance, so in this case, `hive`.

`alter database hive owner to hive;`

![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/deathwing/23tkk3PMDiaaspZsH4fWxMfteMsqcmqw1P3uyzrLZTXnBJQ1AsnKpbEcq3KU5Jc8mMrXv.png)

Next, you will need to set up an intarray extension in the database `hive`.

`\c hive`
`create extension intarray;`

Type `\q` to exit postgres and return to terminal.

The next step is to clone the repository for Hivemind.

Use `git clone https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind.git`

Next, `cd` into the hivemind directory and installing prerequisites. (if you'd like to run tests)

`cd hivemind`
`git submodule update --init --recursive`

Next step is to start building and installing hivemind.

`python3 setup.py build`
`python3 setup.py install`


![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/deathwing/23tRxSJgh4nF3dtPYtJVzn4m6LGzgQ8X4H67gWiX3eS6iqH6zm9B1gZXkjgveEBq3zz6x.png)

After the build has been successfully completed, export the database information and node information.

`export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://hive:hive@localhost:5432/hive` (hive:hive is user:password).
`export STEEMD_URL='{&quot;default&quot;:&quot;http://apinode:8091&quot;}'`

After everything is set up, you can run Hivemind with `hive sync`.


![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/deathwing/EoATUJKgNA7LDETYTfJJtdz53dwoquqYmG2wQpZhjFTThuhPqjVFsg3bWc9TPZrHWrg.png)

![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/deathwing/23tRxSKeYEg9BZPnmwFsbrzwSVWwuFH8W4An6HnM1Qqm4Wsy4RyWNdhuzMWhG1d6Vfpm2.png)



If your set up was correct and your node is a private, preferably local node, your hivemind instance will start syncing. Just so you know the syncing process can take several days.

To start the server (for incoming calls) you can use `hive server`.


![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/deathwing/EoATVNbcYtNqDHp9cACh9dHq3zj8bzUnYD5HvYmqjGj1UeZxr5mPQkkJrPNpKh1ufJL.png)
&lt;sub&gt;As this is a test instance, it is not fully synced. So a fully synced hivemind will look different, especially *database_head_block* :)&lt;/sub&gt;

#### The End

Please don't forget that this is not recommended for use in production environments, please use Docker in that scenario.

Also, if this helped you and you have an extra witness vote, I'd like to remind you that I am a witness! You are more than welcome to vote for my witness [here](https://peakd.com/me/witnesses).

Games are fun and most people like to play different kinds of games. I'm not sure about the game we are building. Whether it be fun or not, the purpose of this project is the tutorial. To have a step-by-step guide that developers can use as a reference in building apps on Hive.

Check out previous posts:

***
#### Building the transactions
We will build the back-end for the front-end that we built in the previous post. All goes into `js/app.js`.
```
const random = (length = 20) =&amp;gt; {
  const chars = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'
  let str = ''
  for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; length; i++) {
    str += chars.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length))
  }
  return str
}
```
A simple function to generate a random string. We will use the random string for the game_id.
***
```
const createGame = async () =&amp;gt; {
  const button = document.getElementById('create-game-btn')
  button.setAttribute('disabled', 'true')
  const errorOutput = document.getElementById('create-game-error')
  const successOutput = document.getElementById('create-game-success')
  errorOutput.innerHTML = ''
  successOutput.innerHTML = ''
  try {
    const game = {
      app: 'tictactoe/0.0.1',
      action: 'create_game',
      id: random(20),
      starting_player: document.getElementById('starting-player').value
    }
    const operations = [
      [
        'custom_json',
        {
          required_auths: [],
          required_posting_auths: [userData.username],
          id: 'tictactoe',
          json: JSON.stringify(game)
        }
      ]
    ]
    const tx = new hiveTx.Transaction()
    await tx.create(operations)
    const privateKey = hiveTx.PrivateKey.from(userData.key)
    tx.sign(privateKey)
    const result = await tx.broadcast()
    if (result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result.block_num) {
      successOutput.innerHTML =
        'Success! &lt;a href=&quot;link to game&quot;&gt;Click to see&lt;/a&gt;'
    } else {
      errorOutput.innerHTML =
        'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J'
      console.error(result)
    }
  } catch (e) {
    errorOutput.innerHTML =
      'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J'
    console.error(e)
  }
  button.removeAttribute('disabled')
}
```
We create the transaction by using the [hive-tx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hive-tx) library then sign and broadcast it. We put the game link in the success message and show it to the user.

Now users can create the game and see the list of games. We create the `game.html` page for users to play the game.
***
#### Game page
We can add the game board, moves history, and the game stats like the winner, player1, and player2. I think we can make this page accessible by the game_id, like `/game.html?id=game_id_here`. Let's create the easier parts first.

`game.html`: We use the head from `index.html` and the same navbar code.
```
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;!-- Modal end --&gt;

  &lt;script src=&quot;js/app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
```
Since we use `app.js` here too, we have to modify 2 lines in `app.js`:
```
// Run the script only in homepage
if (!window.location.pathname.match(/game.html$/)) {
  loadTheGames()
  setInterval(() =&amp;gt; loadTheGames(), 5000)
}
```
In the above code, we can define which scripts to run on the homepage and which run on the game page.

We need an API for retrieving the game details by game_id. Let's set that up in the back-end.
`api/game.js`:
```
const mysql = require('../helpers/mysql')
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()

router.get('/game/:id', async (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  try {
    const id = req.params.id
    if (!id || id.length !== 20 || !id.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/)) {
      return res.json({
        id: 0,
        error: 'Wrong id.'
      })
    }
    const game = await mysql.query(
      'SELECT `game_id`, `player1`, `player2`, `starting_player`, `status`, `winner` FROM `games`' +
        'WHERE `game_id`=?',
      [id]
    )
    if (!game || !Array.isArray(game) || game.length &amp;lt; 1) {
      return res.json({
        id: 1,
        game: []
      })
    }
    return res.json({
      id: 1,
      game
    })
  } catch (e) {
    return res.json({
      id: 0,
      error: 'Unexpected error.'
    })
  }
})

module.exports = router
```
The above code is similar to the other APIs we set up. Nothing new here. Now we can show the game details on the game.html page.

```
const getGameDetails = async (id) =&amp;gt; {
  const data = await APICall('/game/' + id)
  if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 0) {
    document.getElementById('details-error').innerHTML = data.error
  } else if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 1) {
    const game = data.game[0]
    document.getElementById('game-details').innerHTML = `&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${game.player1}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${game.player2}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${game.starting_player}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${game.status}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${game.winner}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;`
    if (game.player1 === userData.username) {
      document.getElementById('req-message-1').style.display = 'block'
      document.getElementById('req-message-2').style.display = 'none'
    }
  }
}
```
And running the above function:
```
const queryString = window.location.search
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString)

// Run the script only in homepage
if (!window.location.pathname.match(/game.html$/)) {
  loadTheGames()
  setInterval(() =&amp;gt; loadTheGames(), 5000)
} else {
  // Run the script only in game page
  if (urlParams.has('id')) {
    getGameDetails(urlParams.get('id'))
  }
}
```
We get the `id` from the page URL and use it in the API call. Then display the data in an HTML table.
```
&lt;table class=&quot;table&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Player1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Player2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Starting player&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Winner&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody id=&quot;game-details&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
```
***
We can get the join requests from API and show them beside the game so player1 can accept one of the coming requests and start the game.
A simple HTML table:
```
&lt;table class=&quot;table&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Player&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Action&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody id=&quot;request-list&quot;&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
```
And the API call:
```
const getRequests = async (id, creator = false) =&amp;gt; {
  const data = await APICall('/requests/' + id)
  if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 0) {
    document.getElementById('requests-error').innerHTML = data.error
  } else if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 1) {
    let temp = ''
    for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; data.requests.length; i++) {
      const request = data.requests[i]
      temp += `&lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;${request.player}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;${request.status}&lt;/td&gt;`
      if (creator) {
        // Add an Accept button if the visitor is player1 (creator)
        temp += `&lt;td&gt;
          &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; onclick=&quot;acceptRequest(${id}, ${request.player})&quot;&gt;
            Accept
          &lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;`
      } else {
        temp += '&lt;td&gt;---&lt;/td&gt;'
      }
      temp += '&lt;/tr&gt;'
    }
    if (data.requests.length &amp;lt; 1) {
      temp = 'None'
    }
    document.getElementById('request-list').innerHTML = temp
  }
}
```
We can call the `getRequests` function inside the `getGameDetails` function because we can know when the user (visitor) is the creator of the game aka player1. Then show them an `Accept` button based on that so the player1 can accept the request.
```
const getGameDetails = async (id) =&amp;gt; {
  ... // skipped unchanged lines
    if (game.player1 === userData.username) {
      document.getElementById('req-message-1').style.display = 'block'
      document.getElementById('req-message-2').style.display = 'none'
      getRequests(id, true)
    } else {
      getRequests(id, false)
    }
  }
}
```

Also, let's make both functions run with an interval to auto-update the data.
```
// Run the script only in homepage
if (!window.location.pathname.match(/game.html$/)) {
  loadTheGames()
  setInterval(() =&amp;gt; loadTheGames(), 5000)
} else {
  // Run the script only in game page
  if (urlParams.has('id')) {
    getGameDetails(urlParams.get('id'))
    setInterval(() =&amp;gt; getGameDetails(urlParams.get('id')), 5000)
  }
}
```
***
We added the `accept` button so let's add its function and transaction too.
```
const acceptRequest = async (id, player) =&amp;gt; {
  const success = document.getElementById('requests-success')
  const error = document.getElementById('requests-error')
  if (!userData.username) {
    return
  }
  try {
    const accept = {
      app: 'tictactoe/0.0.1',
      action: 'accept_request',
      id,
      player
    }
    const operations = [
      [
        'custom_json',
        {
          required_auths: [],
          required_posting_auths: [userData.username],
          id: 'tictactoe',
          json: JSON.stringify(accept)
        }
      ]
    ]
    const tx = new hiveTx.Transaction()
    await tx.create(operations)
    const privateKey = hiveTx.PrivateKey.from(userData.key)
    tx.sign(privateKey)
    const result = await tx.broadcast()
    if (result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result.block_num) {
      success.innerHTML = 'Success! Game started.'
    } else {
      error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J'
      console.error(result)
    }
  } catch (e) {
    error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J'
    console.error(e)
  }
}
```
***
Now let's add a button for other users to join the game.
```
&lt;button id=&quot;join-btn&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; onclick=&quot;joinGame()&quot;&gt;Join the game&lt;/button&gt;
```
And build the transaction for it:
```
const joinGame = async (gameId) =&amp;gt; {
  const success = document.getElementById('join-success')
  const error = document.getElementById('join-error')
  if (!urlParams.has('id')) {
    return
  }
  const id = urlParams.get('id')
  try {
    const joinReq = {
      app: 'tictactoe/0.0.1',
      action: 'request_join',
      id
    }
    const operations = [
      [
        'custom_json',
        {
          required_auths: [],
          required_posting_auths: [userData.username],
          id: 'tictactoe',
          json: JSON.stringify(joinReq)
        }
      ]
    ]
    const tx = new hiveTx.Transaction()
    await tx.create(operations)
    const privateKey = hiveTx.PrivateKey.from(userData.key)
    tx.sign(privateKey)
    const result = await tx.broadcast()
    if (result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result.block_num) {
      success.innerHTML = 'Success! Your request submitted.'
    } else {
      error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J'
      console.error(result)
    }
  } catch (e) {
    error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J'
    console.error(e)
  }
}
```

## Next part
We finally finished most of the functions needed for starting the game. I think the only remaining challenge is the gameplay. We can use Canvas for the front-end graphical gameplay. I already built a project with Canvas but there is nothing easy about coding. It's still a challenge.

Let me list the remaining tasks:
- Gameplay front-end
- Gameplay back-end
- resync method for the database
- Front-end polishing

We are getting to the end of this project and I think we can finish it in the next post and finally play this boring game at least once.

Making tutorials and coding at the same time is really hard and tiring. I might continue writing this kind of series for different projects if there is enough interest but the target audience is too small. So let me know in the comments what you think.

I wouldn't mind building an interesting app or game which can be some kind of tutorial too.

TBH after writing the above line I wanted to remove it. Let's see what happens.

Thanks for reading. Make sure to follow me and share the post. Upvote if you like and leave a comment.

I'm not sure about the game we are building. Whether it be fun or not, the purpose of this project is the tutorial. To have a step-by-step guide that developers can use as a reference in building apps on Hive. Check out previous posts: *** #### Building the transactions We will build the back-end for the front-end that we built in the previous post. All goes into `js/app.js`. ``` const random = (length = 20) =&amp;gt; { const chars = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789' let str = '' for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; length; i++) { str += chars.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length)) } return str } ``` A simple function to generate a random string. We will use the random string for the game_id. *** ``` const createGame = async () =&amp;gt; { const button = document.getElementById('create-game-btn') button.setAttribute('disabled', 'true') const errorOutput = document.getElementById('create-game-error') const successOutput = document.getElementById('create-game-success') errorOutput.innerHTML = '' successOutput.innerHTML = '' try { const game = { app: 'tictactoe/0.0.1', action: 'create_game', id: random(20), starting_player: document.getElementById('starting-player').value } const operations = [ [ 'custom_json', { required_auths: [], required_posting_auths: [userData.username], id: 'tictactoe', json: JSON.stringify(game) } ] ] const tx = new hiveTx.Transaction() await tx.create(operations) const privateKey = hiveTx.PrivateKey.from(userData.key) tx.sign(privateKey) const result = await tx.broadcast() if (result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result.block_num) { successOutput.innerHTML = 'Success! Click to see' } else { errorOutput.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J' console.error(result) } } catch (e) { errorOutput.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J' console.error(e) } button.removeAttribute('disabled') } ``` We create the transaction by using the [hive-tx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hive-tx) library then sign and broadcast it. We put the game link in the success message and show it to the user. Now users can create the game and see the list of games. We create the `game.html` page for users to play the game. *** #### Game page We can add the game board, moves history, and the game stats like the winner, player1, and player2. I think we can make this page accessible by the game_id, like `/game.html?id=game_id_here`. Let's create the easier parts first. `game.html`: We use the head from `index.html` and the same navbar code. ``` &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt; Tic-Tac-Toe on Hive blockchain Tic-Tac-Toe Login Logout Login Username: @ Your Hive username. Lowercase. Posting key: Your key will never leave your browser. Login Close ``` Since we use `app.js` here too, we have to modify 2 lines in `app.js`: ``` // Run the script only in homepage if (!window.location.pathname.match(/game.html$/)) { loadTheGames() setInterval(() =&amp;gt; loadTheGames(), 5000) } ``` In the above code, we can define which scripts to run on the homepage and which run on the game page. We need an API for retrieving the game details by game_id. Let's set that up in the back-end. `api/game.js`: ``` const mysql = require('../helpers/mysql') const express = require('express') const router = express.Router() router.get('/game/:id', async (req, res) =&amp;gt; { try { const id = req.params.id if (!id || id.length !== 20 || !id.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/)) { return res.json({ id: 0, error: 'Wrong id.' }) } const game = await mysql.query( 'SELECT `game_id`, `player1`, `player2`, `starting_player`, `status`, `winner` FROM `games`' + 'WHERE `game_id`=?', [id] ) if (!game || !Array.isArray(game) || game.length &amp;lt; 1) { return res.json({ id: 1, game: [] }) } return res.json({ id: 1, game }) } catch (e) { return res.json({ id: 0, error: 'Unexpected error.' }) } }) module.exports = router ``` The above code is similar to the other APIs we set up. Nothing new here. Now we can show the game details on the game.html page. ``` const getGameDetails = async (id) =&amp;gt; { const data = await APICall('/game/' + id) if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 0) { document.getElementById('details-error').innerHTML = data.error } else if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 1) { const game = data.game[0] document.getElementById('game-details').innerHTML = ` ${game.player1} ${game.player2} ${game.starting_player} ${game.status} ${game.winner} ` if (game.player1 === userData.username) { document.getElementById('req-message-1').style.display = 'block' document.getElementById('req-message-2').style.display = 'none' } } } ``` And running the above function: ``` const queryString = window.location.search const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString) // Run the script only in homepage if (!window.location.pathname.match(/game.html$/)) { loadTheGames() setInterval(() =&amp;gt; loadTheGames(), 5000) } else { // Run the script only in game page if (urlParams.has('id')) { getGameDetails(urlParams.get('id')) } } ``` We get the `id` from the page URL and use it in the API call. Then display the data in an HTML table. ``` Player1 Player2 Starting player Status Winner ``` *** We can get the join requests from API and show them beside the game so player1 can accept one of the coming requests and start the game. A simple HTML table: ``` Player Status Action ``` And the API call: ``` const getRequests = async (id, creator = false) =&amp;gt; { const data = await APICall('/requests/' + id) if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 0) { document.getElementById('requests-error').innerHTML = data.error } else if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 1) { let temp = '' for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; data.requests.length; i++) { const request = data.requests[i] temp += ` ${request.player} ${request.status}` if (creator) { // Add an Accept button if the visitor is player1 (creator) temp += ` Accept ` } else { temp += '---' } temp += '' } if (data.requests.length &amp;lt; 1) { temp = 'None' } document.getElementById('request-list').innerHTML = temp } } ``` We can call the `getRequests` function inside the `getGameDetails` function because we can know when the user (visitor) is the creator of the game aka player1. Then show them an `Accept` button based on that so the player1 can accept the request. ``` const getGameDetails = async (id) =&amp;gt; { ... // skipped unchanged lines if (game.player1 === userData.username) { document.getElementById('req-message-1').style.display = 'block' document.getElementById('req-message-2').style.display = 'none' getRequests(id, true) } else { getRequests(id, false) } } } ``` Also, let's make both functions run with an interval to auto-update the data. ``` // Run the script only in homepage if (!window.location.pathname.match(/game.html$/)) { loadTheGames() setInterval(() =&amp;gt; loadTheGames(), 5000) } else { // Run the script only in game page if (urlParams.has('id')) { getGameDetails(urlParams.get('id')) setInterval(() =&amp;gt; getGameDetails(urlParams.get('id')), 5000) } } ``` *** We added the `accept` button so let's add its function and transaction too. ``` const acceptRequest = async (id, player) =&amp;gt; { const success = document.getElementById('requests-success') const error = document.getElementById('requests-error') if (!userData.username) { return } try { const accept = { app: 'tictactoe/0.0.1', action: 'accept_request', id, player } const operations = [ [ 'custom_json', { required_auths: [], required_posting_auths: [userData.username], id: 'tictactoe', json: JSON.stringify(accept) } ] ] const tx = new hiveTx.Transaction() await tx.create(operations) const privateKey = hiveTx.PrivateKey.from(userData.key) tx.sign(privateKey) const result = await tx.broadcast() if (result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result.block_num) { success.innerHTML = 'Success! Game started.' } else { error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J' console.error(result) } } catch (e) { error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J' console.error(e) } } ``` *** Now let's add a button for other users to join the game. ``` Join the game ``` And build the transaction for it: ``` const joinGame = async (gameId) =&amp;gt; { const success = document.getElementById('join-success') const error = document.getElementById('join-error') if (!urlParams.has('id')) { return } const id = urlParams.get('id') try { const joinReq = { app: 'tictactoe/0.0.1', action: 'request_join', id } const operations = [ [ 'custom_json', { required_auths: [], required_posting_auths: [userData.username], id: 'tictactoe', json: JSON.stringify(joinReq) } ] ] const tx = new hiveTx.Transaction() await tx.create(operations) const privateKey = hiveTx.PrivateKey.from(userData.key) tx.sign(privateKey) const result = await tx.broadcast() if (result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result.block_num) { success.innerHTML = 'Success! Your request submitted.' } else { error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J' console.error(result) } } catch (e) { error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J' console.error(e) } } ``` *** ## Next part We finally finished most of the functions needed for starting the game. I think the only remaining challenge is the gameplay. We can use Canvas for the front-end graphical gameplay. I already built a project with Canvas but there is nothing easy about coding. It's still a challenge. Let me list the remaining tasks: - Gameplay front-end - Gameplay back-end - resync method for the database - Front-end polishing We are getting to the end of this project and I think we can finish it in the next post and finally play this boring game at least once. Making tutorials and coding at the same time is really hard and tiring. I might continue writing this kind of series for different projects if there is enough interest but the target audience is too small. So let me know in the comments what you think. I wouldn't mind building an interesting app or game which can be some kind of tutorial too. TBH after writing the above line I wanted to remove it. Let's see what happens. Thanks for reading.
