One of the tools I maintain is Tin Toy.  It's a docker image for running a tiny Hive testnet on your local computer.

With it, you can point your application and test new functionality, without having to broadcast to the mainnet.

I just did a refresh on the `develop` branch so you can try out the next hardfork, HF26.

It's also a tool that comes in handy for me, when I'm doing [documentation](https://peakd.com/c/hive-139531/search?q=devportal), because it helps me find new functionality and create tutorials.  You'll find that anytime the devportal mentions a testnet, it's going to recommend tintoy.  And so for this reason, I feel like this is time well spent when researching and improving the devportal.

To try out the hived 1.26.0, right now:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8090:8090 inertia/tintoy:develop
```

Then point your app API endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

Tin Toy - A tiny Hive testnet based on [tinman](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/tinman)

# Quickstart

```bash
docker run -d -p 8090:8090 inertia/tintoy:latest
```

Using `-p 8090:8090` will expose json-rpc.

... or ...

```bash
docker run -d -P inertia/tintoy:latest
```

Using `-P` will expose all of the ports, ephemerally (see below).

If you want to modify the scripts before deploying:

```bash
git clone https://gist.github.com/b88e7bfff8862858e54c59392e2bce20.git tintoy
cd tintoy
docker build -t myname/tintoy:mybranch .
docker run -d -P myname/tintoy:mybranch
```

For example, you can modify the first line of `Dockerfile` to switch versions of `hived`.

Tin Toy uses:

```Dockerfile
FROM hiveio/hive:latest
```

But you can switch to any branch and try it out.  Suggested branches to try can be found in [hive/activity](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/activity).

Say we want to take a look at a branch like `develop`.  Change the first line of the `Dockerfile` to:

```Dockerfile
FROM hiveio/hive:develop
```

Then build and run.

# Shell In

* Use `docker ps` to get the name of the existing container.
* Use the command `docker exec -it &lt;container name=&quot;&quot;&gt; /bin/bash` to get a bash shell in the container.

# How to Use

Once the docker container has fully deployed, you'll have access to various port.  Internally, the docker container responds to:

| Port | Purpose   |
|------|-----------|
| 2001 | p2p       |
| 8090 | jussi json-rpc |
| 8091 | hived json-rpc |
| 8092 | hivemind json-rpc |
| 5000 | tinman server (if enabled) |

If you launched with `-P` (ephemeral ports enabled), you can get a list of ports:

```bash
docker ps
```

Which might return something like:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                                                NAMES
290810dba18e        inertia/tintoy:latest   &quot;/bin/sh -c /app/boo…&quot;   5 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes        0.0.0.0:32832-&amp;gt;2001/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32831-&amp;gt;8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32830-&amp;gt;8090/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32829-&amp;gt;8091/tcp   tintoy
```

## Default Secret Key

Normally, the secret key for a testnet is kept secret.  But for a local testnet, there's no reason to keep it a secret.  For tintoy, the default secret key is set in the `Dockerfile`:

```bash
ENV SHARED_SECRET tintoy
```

Which means, if you want to derive the private keys for `tnman`, you could use the following command:

```bash
get_dev_key tintoy owner-tnman active-tnman posting-tnman memo-tnman | jq
```

```json
[
  {
    &quot;private_key&quot;: &quot;5K5kjWq8pY23YptZaiEkiiaKi1wafufj63nzAtaDu1epVXw9fvz&quot;,
    &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;TST7uubH7SpknapasQTzW1rFho3LUn1pFmdR7X4f1cHmK22aTJYm3&quot;,
    &quot;account_name&quot;: &quot;owner-tnman&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;private_key&quot;: &quot;5K3NwkFwCnsSfJNACw1qm3zzojWBtP8k4rTb2kbLQ4DDR6TgGnw&quot;,
    &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;TST4w9GXogQtqPprzPhp7WKZPPKWXv4KvqqMMgd5agJQCDtYLBJwA&quot;,
    &quot;account_name&quot;: &quot;active-tnman&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;private_key&quot;: &quot;5Jrdrbt5xfjVeHfHd5JMiJy1FfrGtuieRvzr9WFYhcdHpjgfwPY&quot;,
    &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;TST883nSqJL5KbVgfdV44snPPDTStQQxfR7vj8XttsZo25sXvHAnQ&quot;,
    &quot;account_name&quot;: &quot;posting-tnman&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;private_key&quot;: &quot;5KB3ddeh5o3WghSM3qQaUthxVt7QZWfNYCoiAW3XYfeDki1oH9z&quot;,
    &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;TST56jtUgZrajuBUgdECYaew6cebjSbKWVdtCKkc4xxLAFZQ9f8A9&quot;,
    &quot;account_name&quot;: &quot;memo-tnman&quot;
  }
]
```

Every account on the testnet uses `tnman` as their account authority.  Using this account, you can sign any transaction for any account.

## Snapshot Refresh

Occasionally, it's a good idea to refresh the `sample-snapshot.json` file.  This process is usually only required to be performed by the repo maintainer, but if you want to do it yourself, here are the steps:

1. Install `tinman` by following that product's [README.md](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/tinman#installation).
2. Next, [generate a new snapshot](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/tinman#taking-a-snapshot).
  * Example: `tinman snapshot -s https://anyx.io -o - | pv &amp;gt; snapshot.json`
3. Once we have our new snapshot, create a sample, overwriting the previous one.
  * Example: `tinman sample -i snapshot.json -o sample-snapshot.json`
4. Delete (or move) `snapshot.json` (we don't need it anymore now that we have `sample-snapshot.json`).
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

I have been involved (voluntarily) with the development of the Condenser &amp;amp; Wallet apps (that are powering https://hive.blog and https://wallet.hive.blog) for quite a while now. There are other great frontends to Hive out there such as https://peakd.com and https://ecency.com but I have always been more or less faithful with the Condenser.

This is a regular report on my new contributions. Some of the new work below might still be in test and not yet deployed.

## Sanitize input fields
I noticed that when creating a new community, users were allowed to use HTML code. Although the HTML is not interpreted it is still displayed (encoded) on the screen which looks bad. Apparently, there is no sanitising code of user input for those fields. This code change adds input sanitisation at creation and content filtering at display to clean up existing data.

Merge request: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/merge_requests/232

## Modifying the community selection on post creation
Myself and other users have often accidentally posted our content in the wrong community because we forgot to select the right one when creating the post. Currently the community selection process is not very obvious. For this change what I've done is:
- create an actually community selector drop down menu in the post editing form
- move it to the bottom right next to the `Post` button

![Community selector](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/uploads/2c64f4229ba3743c83cf0afcb37f9d91/Screen_Shot_2021-04-09_at_4.51.17_pm.jpg)

To change community, you don't have to go back to browse through them anymore, the menu should make it easier.

There are other great frontends to Hive out there such as https://peakd.com and https://ecency.com but I have always been more or less faithful with the Condenser. This is a regular report on my new contributions. Some of the new work below might still be in test and not yet deployed. ## Sanitize input fields I noticed that when creating a new community, users were allowed to use HTML code. Although the HTML is not interpreted it is still displayed (encoded) on the screen which looks bad. Apparently, there is no sanitising code of user input for those fields. This code change adds input sanitisation at creation and content filtering at display to clean up existing data. Merge request: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/merge_requests/232 ## Modifying the community selection on post creation Myself and other users have often accidentally posted our content in the wrong community because we forgot to select the right one when creating the post. Currently the community selection process is not very obvious. For this change what I've done is: - create an actually community selector drop down menu in the post editing form - move it to the bottom right next to the `Post` button ![Community selector](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/uploads/2c64f4229ba3743c83cf0afcb37f9d91/Screen_Shot_2021-04-09_at_4.51.17_pm.jpg) To change community, you don't have to go back to browse through them anymore, the menu should make it easier. ![Community selector](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/uploads/00cc3a8373a5914ee8dc506928e7af4a/Screen_Shot_2021-04-09_at_5.07.49_pm.jpg) --- **Vote for my witness** [![Support @quochuy Witness.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmecYTZemY8SwU6rrg7awhpNRBsehUp7ivk9RGyZsUUpVw/quochuy-hive-witness.jpg)](https://hivesigner.com/sign/account-witness-vote?witness=quochuy&amp;amp;approve=1) On Hive, Witnesses are playing the important role of providing a performant and safe network for all of us.

#### Preface

This tutorial assumes that you have a server with hived installed and synced. As well as a server capable of running [Hivemind](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind). (preferably Ubuntu 20.04)

If you would like to run a production environment Hivemind, please run a docker container. It is a lot easier to set up and the potential of something going wrong is a lot less than manual setup. (Also recommended)

#### Getting Started

First of all, you would need to install PostgreSQL 12, since that is what we're using for Hivemind at the moment, as well as the main requirements for Hivemind.

`apt install postgresql git python3 python3-dev build-essential libpq-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libffi-dev`

After the installation is complete, you will need to go into postgres. (This is similar to MySQL -uroot)

`sudo -u postgres psql`

then, create the database user.

`create user hive with password 'hive';`


![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/deathwing/23tRxJBSsvGs8kKGcrU1f7twSivSfs2bybmpEHkRHNHKcxhEuQf7g8byrCoxdzoremfnC.png)

Next step, create the database.

`create database hive;`


![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/deathwing/23tkjayTiHw8sVBiXwXn72naK4FB3DfoVXehYyHvZa6MTPiMDzmjfEWKRcJM7Sqv7KVak.png)


By default, a database is owned by user `postgres` you will need to change this to the user that you will be using for your Hivemind instance, so in this case, `hive`.

`alter database hive owner to hive;`

![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/deathwing/23tkk3PMDiaaspZsH4fWxMfteMsqcmqw1P3uyzrLZTXnBJQ1AsnKpbEcq3KU5Jc8mMrXv.png)

Next, you will need to set up an intarray extension in the database `hive`.

`\c hive`
`create extension intarray;`

Type `\q` to exit postgres and return to terminal.

The next step is to clone the repository for Hivemind.

Use `git clone https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind.git`

Next, `cd` into the hivemind directory and installing prerequisites. (if you'd like to run tests)

`cd hivemind`
`git submodule update --init --recursive`

Next step is to start building and installing hivemind.

`python3 setup.py build`
`python3 setup.py install`


![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/deathwing/23tRxSJgh4nF3dtPYtJVzn4m6LGzgQ8X4H67gWiX3eS6iqH6zm9B1gZXkjgveEBq3zz6x.png)

After the build has been successfully completed, export the database information and node information.

`export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://hive:hive@localhost:5432/hive` (hive:hive is user:password).
`export STEEMD_URL='{&quot;default&quot;:&quot;http://apinode:8091&quot;}'`

After everything is set up, you can run Hivemind with `hive sync`.


![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/deathwing/EoATUJKgNA7LDETYTfJJtdz53dwoquqYmG2wQpZhjFTThuhPqjVFsg3bWc9TPZrHWrg.png)

![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/deathwing/23tRxSKeYEg9BZPnmwFsbrzwSVWwuFH8W4An6HnM1Qqm4Wsy4RyWNdhuzMWhG1d6Vfpm2.png)



If your set up was correct and your node is a private, preferably local node, your hivemind instance will start syncing. Just so you know the syncing process can take several days.

To start the server (for incoming calls) you can use `hive server`.


![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/deathwing/EoATVNbcYtNqDHp9cACh9dHq3zj8bzUnYD5HvYmqjGj1UeZxr5mPQkkJrPNpKh1ufJL.png)
&lt;sub&gt;As this is a test instance, it is not fully synced. So a fully synced hivemind will look different, especially *database_head_block* :)&lt;/sub&gt;

#### The End

Please don't forget that this is not recommended for use in production environments, please use Docker in that scenario.

Also, if this helped you and you have an extra witness vote, I'd like to remind you that I am a witness! You are more than welcome to vote for my witness [here](https://peakd.com/me/witnesses).

Games are fun and most people like to play different kinds of games. I'm not sure about the game we are building. Whether it be fun or not, the purpose of this project is the tutorial. To have a step-by-step guide that developers can use as a reference in building apps on Hive.

***
#### Building the transactions
We will build the back-end for the front-end that we built in the previous post. All goes into `js/app.js`.
```
const random = (length = 20) =&amp;gt; {
  const chars = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'
  let str = ''
  for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; length; i++) {
    str += chars.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length))
  }
  return str
}
```
A simple function to generate a random string. We will use the random string for the game_id.
***
```
const createGame = async () =&amp;gt; {
  const button = document.getElementById('create-game-btn')
  button.setAttribute('disabled', 'true')
  const errorOutput = document.getElementById('create-game-error')
  const successOutput = document.getElementById('create-game-success')
  errorOutput.innerHTML = ''
  successOutput.innerHTML = ''
  try {
    const game = {
      app: 'tictactoe/0.0.1',
      action: 'create_game',
      id: random(20),
      starting_player: document.getElementById('starting-player').value
    }
    const operations = [
      [
        'custom_json',
        {
          required_auths: [],
          required_posting_auths: [userData.username],
          id: 'tictactoe',
          json: JSON.stringify(game)
        }
      ]
    ]
    const tx = new hiveTx.Transaction()
    await tx.create(operations)
    const privateKey = hiveTx.PrivateKey.from(userData.key)
    tx.sign(privateKey)
    const result = await tx.broadcast()
    if (result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result.block_num) {
      successOutput.innerHTML =
        'Success! &lt;a href=&quot;link to game&quot;&gt;Click to see&lt;/a&gt;'
    } else {
      errorOutput.innerHTML =
        'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J'
      console.error(result)
    }
  } catch (e) {
    errorOutput.innerHTML =
      'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J'
    console.error(e)
  }
  button.removeAttribute('disabled')
}
```
We create the transaction by using the [hive-tx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hive-tx) library then sign and broadcast it. We put the game link in the success message and show it to the user.

Now users can create the game and see the list of games. We create the `game.html` page for users to play the game.
***
#### Game page
We can add the game board, moves history, and the game stats like the winner, player1, and player2. I think we can make this page accessible by the game_id, like `/game.html?id=game_id_here`. Let's create the easier parts first.

`game.html`: We use the head from `index.html` and the same navbar code.
```
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;!-- Modal end --&gt;

  &lt;script src=&quot;js/app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
```
Since we use `app.js` here too, we have to modify 2 lines in `app.js`:
```
// Run the script only in homepage
if (!window.location.pathname.match(/game.html$/)) {
  loadTheGames()
  setInterval(() =&amp;gt; loadTheGames(), 5000)
}
```
In the above code, we can define which scripts to run on the homepage and which run on the game page.

We need an API for retrieving the game details by game_id. Let's set that up in the back-end.
`api/game.js`:
```
const mysql = require('../helpers/mysql')
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()

router.get('/game/:id', async (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  try {
    const id = req.params.id
    if (!id || id.length !== 20 || !id.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/)) {
      return res.json({
        id: 0,
        error: 'Wrong id.'
      })
    }
    const game = await mysql.query(
      'SELECT `game_id`, `player1`, `player2`, `starting_player`, `status`, `winner` FROM `games`' +
        'WHERE `game_id`=?',
      [id]
    )
    if (!game || !Array.isArray(game) || game.length &amp;lt; 1) {
      return res.json({
        id: 1,
        game: []
      })
    }
    return res.json({
      id: 1,
      game
    })
  } catch (e) {
    return res.json({
      id: 0,
      error: 'Unexpected error.'
    })
  }
})

module.exports = router
```
The above code is similar to the other APIs we set up. Nothing new here. Now we can show the game details on the game.html page.

```
const getGameDetails = async (id) =&amp;gt; {
  const data = await APICall('/game/' + id)
  if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 0) {
    document.getElementById('details-error').innerHTML = data.error
  } else if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 1) {
    const game = data.game[0]
    document.getElementById('game-details').innerHTML = `&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${game.player1}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${game.player2}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${game.starting_player}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${game.status}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${game.winner}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;`
    if (game.player1 === userData.username) {
      document.getElementById('req-message-1').style.display = 'block'
      document.getElementById('req-message-2').style.display = 'none'
    }
  }
}
```
And running the above function:
```
const queryString = window.location.search
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString)

// Run the script only in homepage
if (!window.location.pathname.match(/game.html$/)) {
  loadTheGames()
  setInterval(() =&amp;gt; loadTheGames(), 5000)
} else {
  // Run the script only in game page
  if (urlParams.has('id')) {
    getGameDetails(urlParams.get('id'))
  }
}
```
We get the `id` from the page URL and use it in the API call. Then display the data in an HTML table.
```
&lt;table class=&quot;table&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Player1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Player2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Starting player&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Winner&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody id=&quot;game-details&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
```
***
We can get the join requests from API and show them beside the game so player1 can accept one of the coming requests and start the game.
A simple HTML table:
```
&lt;table class=&quot;table&quot;&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Player&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Action&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody id=&quot;request-list&quot;&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
```
And the API call:
```
const getRequests = async (id, creator = false) =&amp;gt; {
  const data = await APICall('/requests/' + id)
  if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 0) {
    document.getElementById('requests-error').innerHTML = data.error
  } else if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 1) {
    let temp = ''
    for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; data.requests.length; i++) {
      const request = data.requests[i]
      temp += `&lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;${request.player}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;${request.status}&lt;/td&gt;`
      if (creator) {
        // Add an Accept button if the visitor is player1 (creator)
        temp += `&lt;td&gt;
          &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; onclick=&quot;acceptRequest(${id}, ${request.player})&quot;&gt;
            Accept
          &lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;`
      } else {
        temp += '&lt;td&gt;---&lt;/td&gt;'
      }
      temp += '&lt;/tr&gt;'
    }
    if (data.requests.length &amp;lt; 1) {
      temp = 'None'
    }
    document.getElementById('request-list').innerHTML = temp
  }
}
```
We can call the `getRequests` function inside the `getGameDetails` function because we can know when the user (visitor) is the creator of the game aka player1. Then show them an `Accept` button based on that so the player1 can accept the request.
```
const getGameDetails = async (id) =&amp;gt; {
  ... // skipped unchanged lines
    if (game.player1 === userData.username) {
      document.getElementById('req-message-1').style.display = 'block'
      document.getElementById('req-message-2').style.display = 'none'
      getRequests(id, true)
    } else {
      getRequests(id, false)
    }
  }
}
```

Also, let's make both functions run with an interval to auto-update the data.
```
// Run the script only in homepage
if (!window.location.pathname.match(/game.html$/)) {
  loadTheGames()
  setInterval(() =&amp;gt; loadTheGames(), 5000)
} else {
  // Run the script only in game page
  if (urlParams.has('id')) {
    getGameDetails(urlParams.get('id'))
    setInterval(() =&amp;gt; getGameDetails(urlParams.get('id')), 5000)
  }
}
```
***
We added the `accept` button so let's add its function and transaction too.
```
const acceptRequest = async (id, player) =&amp;gt; {
  const success = document.getElementById('requests-success')
  const error = document.getElementById('requests-error')
  if (!userData.username) {
    return
  }
  try {
    const accept = {
      app: 'tictactoe/0.0.1',
      action: 'accept_request',
      id,
      player
    }
    const operations = [
      [
        'custom_json',
        {
          required_auths: [],
          required_posting_auths: [userData.username],
          id: 'tictactoe',
          json: JSON.stringify(accept)
        }
      ]
    ]
    const tx = new hiveTx.Transaction()
    await tx.create(operations)
    const privateKey = hiveTx.PrivateKey.from(userData.key)
    tx.sign(privateKey)
    const result = await tx.broadcast()
    if (result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result.block_num) {
      success.innerHTML = 'Success! Game started.'
    } else {
      error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J'
      console.error(result)
    }
  } catch (e) {
    error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J'
    console.error(e)
  }
}
```
***
Now let's add a button for other users to join the game.
```
&lt;button id=&quot;join-btn&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; onclick=&quot;joinGame()&quot;&gt;Join the game&lt;/button&gt;
```
And build the transaction for it:
```
const joinGame = async (gameId) =&amp;gt; {
  const success = document.getElementById('join-success')
  const error = document.getElementById('join-error')
  if (!urlParams.has('id')) {
    return
  }
  const id = urlParams.get('id')
  try {
    const joinReq = {
      app: 'tictactoe/0.0.1',
      action: 'request_join',
      id
    }
    const operations = [
      [
        'custom_json',
        {
          required_auths: [],
          required_posting_auths: [userData.username],
          id: 'tictactoe',
          json: JSON.stringify(joinReq)
        }
      ]
    ]
    const tx = new hiveTx.Transaction()
    await tx.create(operations)
    const privateKey = hiveTx.PrivateKey.from(userData.key)
    tx.sign(privateKey)
    const result = await tx.broadcast()
    if (result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result.block_num) {
      success.innerHTML = 'Success! Your request submitted.'
    } else {
      error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J'
      console.error(result)
    }
  } catch (e) {
    error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J'
    console.error(e)
  }
}
```

## Next part
We finally finished most of the functions needed for starting the game. I think the only remaining challenge is the gameplay. We can use Canvas for the front-end graphical gameplay. I already built a project with Canvas but there is nothing easy about coding. It's still a challenge.

Let me list the remaining tasks:
- Gameplay front-end
- Gameplay back-end
- resync method for the database
- Front-end polishing

We are getting to the end of this project and I think we can finish it in the next post and finally play this boring game at least once.

Making tutorials and coding at the same time is really hard and tiring. I might continue writing this kind of series for different projects if there is enough interest but the target audience is too small. So let me know in the comments what you think.

I wouldn't mind building an interesting app or game which can be some kind of tutorial too.

TBH after writing the above line I wanted to remove it. Let's see what happens.

Thanks for reading. Make sure to follow me and share the post. Upvote if you like and leave a comment.


Enjoy the cat.

I'm not sure about the game we are building. Whether it be fun or not, the purpose of this project is the tutorial. To have a step-by-step guide that developers can use as a reference in building apps on Hive. Check out previous posts: *** #### Building the transactions We will build the back-end for the front-end that we built in the previous post. All goes into `js/app.js`. ``` const random = (length = 20) =&amp;gt; { const chars = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789' let str = '' for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; length; i++) { str += chars.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length)) } return str } ``` A simple function to generate a random string. We will use the random string for the game_id. *** ``` const createGame = async () =&amp;gt; { const button = document.getElementById('create-game-btn') button.setAttribute('disabled', 'true') const errorOutput = document.getElementById('create-game-error') const successOutput = document.getElementById('create-game-success') errorOutput.innerHTML = '' successOutput.innerHTML = '' try { const game = { app: 'tictactoe/0.0.1', action: 'create_game', id: random(20), starting_player: document.getElementById('starting-player').value } const operations = [ [ 'custom_json', { required_auths: [], required_posting_auths: [userData.username], id: 'tictactoe', json: JSON.stringify(game) } ] ] const tx = new hiveTx.Transaction() await tx.create(operations) const privateKey = hiveTx.PrivateKey.from(userData.key) tx.sign(privateKey) const result = await tx.broadcast() if (result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result.block_num) { successOutput.innerHTML = 'Success! Click to see' } else { errorOutput.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J' console.error(result) } } catch (e) { errorOutput.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J' console.error(e) } button.removeAttribute('disabled') } ``` We create the transaction by using the [hive-tx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hive-tx) library then sign and broadcast it. We put the game link in the success message and show it to the user. Now users can create the game and see the list of games. We create the `game.html` page for users to play the game. *** #### Game page We can add the game board, moves history, and the game stats like the winner, player1, and player2. I think we can make this page accessible by the game_id, like `/game.html?id=game_id_here`. Let's create the easier parts first. `game.html`: We use the head from `index.html` and the same navbar code. ``` &amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt; Tic-Tac-Toe on Hive blockchain Tic-Tac-Toe Login Logout Login Username: @ Your Hive username. Lowercase. Posting key: Your key will never leave your browser. Login Close ``` Since we use `app.js` here too, we have to modify 2 lines in `app.js`: ``` // Run the script only in homepage if (!window.location.pathname.match(/game.html$/)) { loadTheGames() setInterval(() =&amp;gt; loadTheGames(), 5000) } ``` In the above code, we can define which scripts to run on the homepage and which run on the game page. We need an API for retrieving the game details by game_id. Let's set that up in the back-end. `api/game.js`: ``` const mysql = require('../helpers/mysql') const express = require('express') const router = express.Router() router.get('/game/:id', async (req, res) =&amp;gt; { try { const id = req.params.id if (!id || id.length !== 20 || !id.match(/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/)) { return res.json({ id: 0, error: 'Wrong id.' }) } const game = await mysql.query( 'SELECT `game_id`, `player1`, `player2`, `starting_player`, `status`, `winner` FROM `games`' + 'WHERE `game_id`=?', [id] ) if (!game || !Array.isArray(game) || game.length &amp;lt; 1) { return res.json({ id: 1, game: [] }) } return res.json({ id: 1, game }) } catch (e) { return res.json({ id: 0, error: 'Unexpected error.' }) } }) module.exports = router ``` The above code is similar to the other APIs we set up. Nothing new here. Now we can show the game details on the game.html page. ``` const getGameDetails = async (id) =&amp;gt; { const data = await APICall('/game/' + id) if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 0) { document.getElementById('details-error').innerHTML = data.error } else if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 1) { const game = data.game[0] document.getElementById('game-details').innerHTML = ` ${game.player1} ${game.player2} ${game.starting_player} ${game.status} ${game.winner} ` if (game.player1 === userData.username) { document.getElementById('req-message-1').style.display = 'block' document.getElementById('req-message-2').style.display = 'none' } } } ``` And running the above function: ``` const queryString = window.location.search const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(queryString) // Run the script only in homepage if (!window.location.pathname.match(/game.html$/)) { loadTheGames() setInterval(() =&amp;gt; loadTheGames(), 5000) } else { // Run the script only in game page if (urlParams.has('id')) { getGameDetails(urlParams.get('id')) } } ``` We get the `id` from the page URL and use it in the API call. Then display the data in an HTML table. ``` Player1 Player2 Starting player Status Winner ``` *** We can get the join requests from API and show them beside the game so player1 can accept one of the coming requests and start the game. A simple HTML table: ``` Player Status Action ``` And the API call: ``` const getRequests = async (id, creator = false) =&amp;gt; { const data = await APICall('/requests/' + id) if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 0) { document.getElementById('requests-error').innerHTML = data.error } else if (data &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.id === 1) { let temp = '' for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; data.requests.length; i++) { const request = data.requests[i] temp += ` ${request.player} ${request.status}` if (creator) { // Add an Accept button if the visitor is player1 (creator) temp += ` Accept ` } else { temp += '---' } temp += '' } if (data.requests.length &amp;lt; 1) { temp = 'None' } document.getElementById('request-list').innerHTML = temp } } ``` We can call the `getRequests` function inside the `getGameDetails` function because we can know when the user (visitor) is the creator of the game aka player1. Then show them an `Accept` button based on that so the player1 can accept the request. ``` const getGameDetails = async (id) =&amp;gt; { ... // skipped unchanged lines if (game.player1 === userData.username) { document.getElementById('req-message-1').style.display = 'block' document.getElementById('req-message-2').style.display = 'none' getRequests(id, true) } else { getRequests(id, false) } } } ``` Also, let's make both functions run with an interval to auto-update the data. ``` // Run the script only in homepage if (!window.location.pathname.match(/game.html$/)) { loadTheGames() setInterval(() =&amp;gt; loadTheGames(), 5000) } else { // Run the script only in game page if (urlParams.has('id')) { getGameDetails(urlParams.get('id')) setInterval(() =&amp;gt; getGameDetails(urlParams.get('id')), 5000) } } ``` *** We added the `accept` button so let's add its function and transaction too. ``` const acceptRequest = async (id, player) =&amp;gt; { const success = document.getElementById('requests-success') const error = document.getElementById('requests-error') if (!userData.username) { return } try { const accept = { app: 'tictactoe/0.0.1', action: 'accept_request', id, player } const operations = [ [ 'custom_json', { required_auths: [], required_posting_auths: [userData.username], id: 'tictactoe', json: JSON.stringify(accept) } ] ] const tx = new hiveTx.Transaction() await tx.create(operations) const privateKey = hiveTx.PrivateKey.from(userData.key) tx.sign(privateKey) const result = await tx.broadcast() if (result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result.block_num) { success.innerHTML = 'Success! Game started.' } else { error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J' console.error(result) } } catch (e) { error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J' console.error(e) } } ``` *** Now let's add a button for other users to join the game. ``` Join the game ``` And build the transaction for it: ``` const joinGame = async (gameId) =&amp;gt; { const success = document.getElementById('join-success') const error = document.getElementById('join-error') if (!urlParams.has('id')) { return } const id = urlParams.get('id') try { const joinReq = { app: 'tictactoe/0.0.1', action: 'request_join', id } const operations = [ [ 'custom_json', { required_auths: [], required_posting_auths: [userData.username], id: 'tictactoe', json: JSON.stringify(joinReq) } ] ] const tx = new hiveTx.Transaction() await tx.create(operations) const privateKey = hiveTx.PrivateKey.from(userData.key) tx.sign(privateKey) const result = await tx.broadcast() if (result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result &amp;amp;&amp;amp; result.result.block_num) { success.innerHTML = 'Success! Your request submitted.' } else { error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J' console.error(result) } } catch (e) { error.innerHTML = 'Error! Check console for details. Press Ctrl+Shift+J' console.error(e) } } ``` *** ## Next part We finally finished most of the functions needed for starting the game. I think the only remaining challenge is the gameplay. We can use Canvas for the front-end graphical gameplay. I already built a project with Canvas but there is nothing easy about coding. It's still a challenge. Let me list the remaining tasks: - Gameplay front-end - Gameplay back-end - resync method for the database - Front-end polishing We are getting to the end of this project and I think we can finish it in the next post and finally play this boring game at least once. Making tutorials and coding at the same time is really hard and tiring. I might continue writing this kind of series for different projects if there is enough interest but the target audience is too small. So let me know in the comments what you think. I wouldn't mind building an interesting app or game which can be some kind of tutorial too. TBH after writing the above line I wanted to remove it. Let's see what happens. Thanks for reading.

# Hived work (blockchain node software)

## Code cleanup and investigation of support for Ubuntu 20

Separate from our hardfork 25 changes, we’ve been doing some general code cleanup to make the code more maintainable, and we also started a task to get the code to compile cleanly under Ubuntu 20 without requiring “fiddling” with the build process.

## HF25 changes (these are described in detail in our Hive roadmap post)

### Expiration of old governance votes
We’ve completed and written tests for all changes related to handling expiration of governance votes (votes for witnesses and Hive Fund proposals).

### Curation rewards calculation changes

We completed analysis and implementation of voting window curation changes for HF25. We’re also writing some tests for the curation calculator, as we found the current tests were inadequate (our changes only triggered one fail of existing tests). 

During the process, we also discovered an error in the implementation of the square-root function used by the current curation algorithm for unsigned 128 bit integers, but we’re removing use of this square-root function in the new curation calculation, as part of our removal of the convergent-linear curve code (this is the code that weakened small votes).

The new curation reward algorithm works as follows: 
* first day (24 hours) linear rewards (equal weight to all voters in that window)
* second window (24 hours to 72 hours/3 days) with reward weight/2
* remaining votes in 3rd window with reward weight/8

Under the new algorithm, anyone voting with the first 24 hours of the post receives the same proportional rewards. In other words, for any given voting strength, the voter will get the same percentage return-on-investment as any other voter during that period. 

Voters voting during the second and third window receive a smaller proportional curation reward (and voters who voted during the first 24 hour period receive a little more reward when voters vote during the 2nd or 3rd window). Note that if no one votes during the first window, then 2nd window voters will receive the same amount of curation as if they had voted during the first window.

The basic idea behind the new algorithm is to encourage voters to find good content, but to put them on an equal footing with voting bots. Under the current algorithm that we’re replacing, voting bots have an advantage because there’s a short window in time to cast a vote for optimal curation rewards.

Note that author rewards are not affected by this change: this change only affects how curation rewards are distributed among voters.

### Hive to HBD conversion operation

The only code we’re still working on in hived for hardfork 25 is the new operation that allows users to convert liquid Hive to HBD. We’re still researching some issues associated with the existing code that computes the median price for Hive, but we expect to have the conversion code completed and tested this week.

### Hardfork code freeze in middle of this month

We expect to do a code freeze on 4/15 (middle of this month) so that witnesses can launch a testnet and begin evaluating and testing the code changes for hardfork 25. 

### Testnet to operate for at least one month

Barring any problems, we expect the testnet to operate for at least one month, then we’ll begin final prep for HF25. 

This will allow time for Hive API libraries and frontend web sites to make changes to provide notifications related to vote expiration and to enable the use of the new Hive→HBD conversion operation and the recurrent payments and rc delegation functionality implemented by @howo. But strictly speaking, most of such frontend functionality can be implemented after the hardfork is executed without causing any problems, so the primary reason for this time interval is to allow for testing and evaluation of the performance of the new algorithms and features.

# Modular hivemind (application framework for 2nd layer apps)

## Syncing modular hivemind from SQL account history plugin

We were able to successfully sync a hivemind instance from the data injected by the SQL account history plugin (with the syncing taking place as the SQL data was injected by the plugin), but we encountered a problem at the end when some of the indexes were being recreated by hivemind as hivemind exited full sync mode and entered live sync mode. We’re investigating this issue now and we expect a fix in the next couple of days.

## Performance measurements for hivemind sync with SQL account history plugin

Despite the issue when exiting full sync mode, we were able to collect some useful performance measurements. 

On the regular hivemind sync version, where we first do a hived replay to fill hivemind’s database, and where we then do a hivemind sync where indexes and foreign keys are dropped automatically and rebuilt at the end), the hivemind sync process took 50983s (hivemind sync) + 4047s (index creation) + 1998s (foreign key creation) = 57028s

On the modified version of hivemind sync, where indexes are created before the sync begins, the hivemind sync took 67947s (regular version was 10918s faster).

Despite the increased time for the modified version (10918s/3600s = 3.03 hours), this allows for an overall decrease  in the time to fully sync the hivemind node using the SQL account history plugin, because it means that the hivemind sync can be started while the hived node is being replayed to fill hivemind’s database. 

In the “regular method”, the total time would be  hived sync (~8 hours) + hivemind full sync time (15.84 hours) = 23.84 hours. With the modified method, it looks like we can get this time down to just hivemind modified sync time (18.87 hours). 

Note that all these times should ultimate be compared with the existing time to do a hivemind sync without the SQL account history plugin (~90+ hours). So it seems possible we could be looking at a 4x or better speedup in the time to do a full hivemind sync of a new node with the SQL account history plugin, if I haven’t messed up any where in my assumptions (I didn’t want to delay this report any longer, so it’s not been “peer-reviewed”).

# Hivemind (social media middle-ware)

## Significantly reduced memory usage by hivemind process

We fixed an issue in hivemind where a dictionary was used as a cache for post ids, and this dictionary was progressively consuming more memory as the blockchain grew in size. We spotted this issue during some our performance testing of hivemind syncing using the data provided by the new SQL account history plugin (but the problem exists for all existing hivemind implementations).

Unfortunately, we haven’t had a chance to measure the exact memory savings for the fix yet, as we were focused on other tasks, but I should have those numbers for our next report.

## Testing hivemind syncing on a low-end server

We’ve setup a low end computer (8GB of RAM and only a conventional hard disk drive, no SSD drive) to see what the minimum requirements are for a full hivemind node are, and to see if we can lower those requirements. In our tests, the hivemind process did manage to finish the full sync process, but it hit some problems during creation of indexes, so we’ll be digging into this issue further in the upcoming week.

## Testing performance of hivemind with Postgres 13

Currently postgres version 10 is the recommended version of the database for use with hivemind, but we did some tests this week to check if hivemind was compatible with the latest version of postgres (version 13) and to measure the relative performance. 

It’s all good news: no code changes were required to support postgres 13, and as an extra bonus, we saw a 5% speedup in full sync time in our test. We didn’t make any comprehensive tests yet of API response time related to SQL query speed, but signs are good that we can only expect performance improvements and no regressions.

## Miscellaneous hivemind bug fixes and documentation

We fixed a couple of small bugs reported by users and frontend devs, such as a pagination issue with a community-related API call and an issue with community name validation:  https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/488
https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/489

And we have an open merge request for the code to generate openapi documentation for the various hivemind API methods: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/486

# Another progress update soon

I’ll probably be putting out another progress update early next week, after we have more performance numbers. I kept delaying this one hoping to include those numbers, but we were caught up in too many tasks and small issues spoiled a bunch of our measurement attempts, and then the Easter holiday hit.&lt;/div&gt;

We didn’t make any comprehensive tests yet of API response time related to SQL query speed, but signs are good that we can only expect performance improvements and no regressions. ## Miscellaneous hivemind bug fixes and documentation We fixed a couple of small bugs reported by users and frontend devs, such as a pagination issue with a community-related API call and an issue with community name validation: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/488 https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/489 And we have an open merge request for the code to generate openapi documentation for the various hivemind API methods: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/486 # Another progress update soon I’ll probably be putting out another progress update early next week, after we have more performance numbers. I kept delaying this one hoping to include those numbers, but we were caught up in too many tasks and small issues spoiled a bunch of our measurement attempts, and then the Easter holiday hit.

In the [previous part](https://hive.blog/hive-139531/@mahdiyari/making-a-decentralized-game-on-hive-part-3), we made a back-end that is streaming blocks and detects 3 methods in custom_json. Create a game, request to join a game, and accept the request. We also set up a MySQL server with 3 tables for the methods.

&lt;sub&gt;You can find the links to the other parts at the end of the post.&lt;/sub&gt;


### API
Let's start by implementing the API for retrieving the games list. Our API is public so it doesn't require user authentication. The API will just return the data synced from the blockchain.
`api/games.js`:
```
const mysql = require('../helpers/mysql')
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()

// Return all games on route /games
router.get('/games', async (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  try {
    // Get games data from Database
    const games = await mysql.query(
      'SELECT `game_id`, `player1`, `player2`, `starting_player`, `status`, `winner` FROM `games`'
    )
    // Check for expected result
    if (!games || !Array.isArray(games) || games.length &amp;lt; 1) {
      // WE return id: 1 for success and id: 0 for errors
      return res.json({
        id: 1,
        games: []
      })
    }
    // We return `games` as we receive from MySQL but it's not a good practice
    // specially when you have critical data in the database
    // You can return data one by one like `games: [{game_id: games.game_id, ...}]`
    return res.json({
      id: 1,
      games
    })
  } catch (e) {
    // Return error for unexpected errors like connection drops
    res.json({
      id: 0,
      error: 'Unexpected error.'
    })
  }
})

module.exports = router
```
The comments are in the code itself for better understanding.
Note: We use `try{} catch{}` wherever we can. It is always good to handle errors.

We can test our API at this point to detect possible errors in the code.
Include the following code in `api/server.js` just above the `port` and `host` constants.
```
const games = require('./games')
app.use(games)
```

Run `node api/server.js`. We can see the console.log: `Application started on 127.0.0.1:2021`
Let's open `127.0.0.1:2021/games` in the browser.

&lt;center&gt;![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmbTKVAbtUB6nDH8HWuvku8NuiZv3jovu94jtEMAEU1vSX/image.png)&lt;/center&gt;
The API works as expected.

But it's not done yet. This API returns ALL the games without a specific order. We should implement pagination and define an order for our list.

Updated code `api/games.js`:
```
const mysql = require('../helpers/mysql')
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()

router.get('/games/:page', async (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  try {
    if (isNaN(req.params.page)) {
      res.json({
        id: 0,
        error: 'Expected number.'
      })
    }
    const page = Math.floor(req.params.page)
    if (page &amp;lt; 1) {
      res.json({
        id: 0,
        error: 'Expected &amp;gt; 0'
      })
    }
    const offset = (page - 1) * 10
    const games = await mysql.query(
      'SELECT `game_id`, `player1`, `player2`, `starting_player`, `status`, `winner` FROM `games`' +
        ' ORDER BY `id` DESC LIMIT 10 OFFSET ?',
      [offset]
    )
    if (!games || !Array.isArray(games) || games.length &amp;lt; 1) {
      return res.json({
        id: 1,
        games: []
      })
    }
    return res.json({
      id: 1,
      games
    })
  } catch (e) {
    res.json({
      id: 0,
      error: 'Unexpected error.'
    })
  }
})

module.exports = router
```
We used `id` to order our list and get the newly created games first. Each page returns up to 10 games. We can try `127.0.0.1:2021/games/1` for testing.
***
Let's set another API for requests. The code is almost similar but we return only requests for the specific game_id.
`api/requests.js`:
```
const mysql = require('../helpers/mysql')
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()

router.get('/requests/:id', async (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  try {
    if (!req.params.id) {
      res.json({
        id: 0,
        error: 'Expected game_id.'
      })
    }
    // We are passing user input into the database
    // You should be careful in such cases
    // We use ? for parameters which escapes the characters
    const requests = await mysql.query(
      'SELECT `player`, `status` FROM `requests` WHERE `game_id`= ?',
      [req.params.id]
    )
    if (!requests || !Array.isArray(requests) || requests.length &amp;lt; 1) {
      return res.json({
        id: 1,
        requests: []
      })
    }
    return res.json({
      id: 1,
      requests
    })
  } catch (e) {
    res.json({
      id: 0,
      error: 'Unexpected error.'
    })
  }
})

module.exports = router
```
Note: `:id` in the above router represents a variable named id. So for example `http://127.0.0.1:2021/requests/mygameidhere` in this request, the `id` variable is `mygameidhere` which is accessible by `req.params.id`.
***
A similar code for the `moves` table. There wasn't a better name in my mind for this table.
`api/moves.js`:
```
const mysql = require('../helpers/mysql')
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()

router.get('/moves/:id', async (req, res) =&amp;gt; {
  try {
    if (!req.params.id) {
      res.json({
        id: 0,
        error: 'Expected game_id.'
      })
    }
    const moves = await mysql.query(
      'SELECT `player`, `col`, `row` FROM `moves` WHERE `game_id`= ?',
      [req.params.id]
    )
    if (!moves || !Array.isArray(moves) || moves.length &amp;lt; 1) {
      return res.json({
        id: 1,
        moves: []
      })
    }
    return res.json({
      id: 1,
      moves
    })
  } catch (e) {
    res.json({
      id: 0,
      error: 'Unexpected error.'
    })
  }
})

module.exports = router
```
Now our 3 APIs are ready to be implemented on the front-end.
***
Here is the updated `api/server.js` after including the APIs:
```
const express = require('express')
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')
const hpp = require('hpp')
const helmet = require('helmet')
const app = express()

// more info: www.npmjs.com/package/hpp
app.use(hpp())
app.use(helmet())

// support json encoded bodies and encoded bodies
app.use(bodyParser.json())
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }))

app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  res.header(
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin',
    'http://localhost https://tic-tac-toe.mahdiyari.info/'
  )
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', true)
  res.header(
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers',
    'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, access_key'
  )
  next()
})

// APIs
const games = require('./games')
const requests = require('./requests')
const moves = require('./moves')

app.use(games)
app.use(requests)
app.use(moves)

const port = process.env.PORT || 2021
const host = process.env.HOST || '127.0.0.1'
app.listen(port, host, () =&amp;gt; {
  console.log(`Application started on ${host}:${port}`)
})
```
***
### Front-end
I think using pure HTML is a mistake and I would prefer something like Angular for the web applications but that comes with its own learning process which can make this tutorial complex. So my recommendation is to learn something like Angular or Vue and live a happy life. Anyway, coding time.

I'm not going to drop `index.html` here. It doesn't need much explanation and it's long. You can see it on the [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/mahdiyari/decentralized-game-on-hive/-/blob/master/front-end/index.html). I will just add some references here used in `app.js`.

The table for listing the games and buttons for pagination.
`index.html`:
```
&lt;div class=&quot;card-body&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h5 class=&quot;card-title&quot; style=&quot;float: left;&quot;&gt;Games list&lt;/h5&gt;
  &lt;span style=&quot;float: right;&quot;&gt;Auto updating every 5s&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;table class=&quot;table table-striped&quot;&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;#&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Game ID&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Player 1&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Player 2&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Starting Player&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Winner&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Action&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody id=&quot;games-table-body&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;nav aria-label=&quot;Page navigation example&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ul class=&quot;pagination justify-content-center&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;page-item disabled&quot; id=&quot;prev-btn&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a class=&quot;page-link&quot; onclick=&quot;prevGamesPage()&quot;&gt;&amp;laquo;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;page-item disabled&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a class=&quot;page-link&quot; id=&quot;page-number&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt; 1 &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li class=&quot;page-item&quot; id=&quot;next-btn&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a class=&quot;page-link&quot; onclick=&quot;nextGamesPage()&quot;&gt;&amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```
***
We have to fill the table above. So let's implement some basic functions.
`js/app.js`:
```
const baseAPI = 'http://127.0.0.1:2021'
const APICall = async (api) =&amp;gt; {
  return (await fetch(baseAPI + api)).json()
}
```
For ease of use, we define a function for `GET` calls using `fetch` and a variable for our API address.
***
```
const getGames = async (page = 1) =&amp;gt; {
  const games = await APICall('/games/' + page)
  return games.games
}
```
This function basically gets the games from the API per page.
***
```
const fillGamesTable = (data) =&amp;gt; {
  const tbody = document.getElementById('games-table-body')
  let temp = ''
  for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; data.length; i++) {
    temp += `&lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${(gamesPage - 1) * 10 + i + 1}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${data[i].game_id}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${data[i].player1}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${data[i].player2}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${data[i].starting_player}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${data[i].status}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;${data[i].winner}&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;`
  }
  if (data.length &amp;lt; 1) {
    temp = 'No games.'
  }
  tbody.innerHTML = temp
}
```
`fillGamesTable` takes the result from `getGames` function and fills the HTML table with data using a `for` loop.
***
```
let gamesPage = 1
const loadTheGames = async () =&amp;gt; {
  const games = await getGames(gamesPage)
  fillGamesTable(games)
  if (games.length &amp;lt; 10) {
    document.getElementById('next-btn').className = 'page-item disabled'
  } else {
    document.getElementById('next-btn').className = 'page-item'
  }
  if (gamesPage === 1) {
    document.getElementById('prev-btn').className = 'page-item disabled'
  } else {
    document.getElementById('prev-btn').className = 'page-item'
  }
  document.getElementById('page-number').innerHTML = ` ${gamesPage} `
}
loadTheGames()
setInterval(() =&amp;gt; loadTheGames(), 5000)
```
With this function, we call the two previously defined functions to do their job and update the pagination buttons and the page number every time we update the table data. Also, every 5 seconds, it gets new data from API and updates the table with new data so users don't have to reload the page for new data.
***
```
const nextGamesPage = () =&amp;gt; {
  gamesPage++
  loadTheGames()
}

const prevGamesPage = () =&amp;gt; {
  gamesPage--
  loadTheGames()
}
```
And two functions for changing pages. Simple as that.
***
The final result with dummy data looks like this on the browser:
&lt;center&gt;![Capture.PNG](https://images.hive.blog/DQmcYZC1vixajRW4Ui5dHiSfTy5MYqEYZhXy2bd2ituz4Ar/Capture.PNG)&lt;/center&gt;
***
That's it for this part. I'm really happy with the results we are getting. I didn't plan anything beforehand and I'm coding as I'm writing the posts.

Today we made 3 API calls and created the basic front-end which for now only shows the list of games that are submitted to the Hive blockchain. In the next part, we will implement the methods for creating and joining the games on the client side. We also probably need to create a game page where actual gaming happens.

Thanks for reading. Make sure to follow me and share the post. Upvote if you like and leave a comment.

Updated code `api/games.js`: ``` const mysql = require('../helpers/mysql') const express = require('express') const router = express.Router() router.get('/games/:page', async (req, res) =&amp;gt; { try { if (isNaN(req.params.page)) { res.json({ id: 0, error: 'Expected number.' }) } const page = Math.floor(req.params.page) if (page &amp;lt; 1) { res.json({ id: 0, error: 'Expected &amp;gt; 0' }) } const offset = (page - 1) * 10 const games = await mysql.query( 'SELECT `game_id`, `player1`, `player2`, `starting_player`, `status`, `winner` FROM `games`' + ' ORDER BY `id` DESC LIMIT 10 OFFSET ?', [offset] ) if (!games || !Array.isArray(games) || games.length &amp;lt; 1) { return res.json({ id: 1, games: [] }) } return res.json({ id: 1, games }) } catch (e) { res.json({ id: 0, error: 'Unexpected error.' }) } }) module.exports = router ``` We used `id` to order our list and get the newly created games first. Each page returns up to 10 games. We can try `127.0.0.1:2021/games/1` for testing. *** Let's set another API for requests. The code is almost similar but we return only requests for the specific game_id. `api/requests.js`: ``` const mysql = require('../helpers/mysql') const express = require('express') const router = express.Router() router.get('/requests/:id', async (req, res) =&amp;gt; { try { if (!req.params.id) { res.json({ id: 0, error: 'Expected game_id.' }) } // We are passing user input into the database // You should be careful in such cases // We use ? for parameters which escapes the characters const requests = await mysql.query( 'SELECT `player`, `status` FROM `requests` WHERE `game_id`= ?', [req.params.id] ) if (!requests || !Array.isArray(requests) || requests.length &amp;lt; 1) { return res.json({ id: 1, requests: [] }) } return res.json({ id: 1, requests }) } catch (e) { res.json({ id: 0, error: 'Unexpected error.' }) } }) module.exports = router ``` Note: `:id` in the above router represents a variable named id. So for example `http://127.0.0.1:2021/requests/mygameidhere` in this request, the `id` variable is `mygameidhere` which is accessible by `req.params.id`. *** A similar code for the `moves` table. There wasn't a better name in my mind for this table. `api/moves.js`: ``` const mysql = require('../helpers/mysql') const express = require('express') const router = express.Router() router.get('/moves/:id', async (req, res) =&amp;gt; { try { if (!req.params.id) { res.json({ id: 0, error: 'Expected game_id.' }) } const moves = await mysql.query( 'SELECT `player`, `col`, `row` FROM `moves` WHERE `game_id`= ?', [req.params.id] ) if (!moves || !Array.isArray(moves) || moves.length &amp;lt; 1) { return res.json({ id: 1, moves: [] }) } return res.json({ id: 1, moves }) } catch (e) { res.json({ id: 0, error: 'Unexpected error.' }) } }) module.exports = router ``` Now our 3 APIs are ready to be implemented on the front-end. *** Here is the updated `api/server.js` after including the APIs: ``` const express = require('express') const bodyParser = require('body-parser') const hpp = require('hpp') const helmet = require('helmet') const app = express() // more info: www.npmjs.com/package/hpp app.use(hpp()) app.use(helmet()) // support json encoded bodies and encoded bodies app.use(bodyParser.json()) app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true })) app.use(function (req, res, next) { res.header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://localhost https://tic-tac-toe.mahdiyari.info/' ) res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', true) res.header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, access_key' ) next() }) // APIs const games = require('./games') const requests = require('./requests') const moves = require('./moves') app.use(games) app.use(requests) app.use(moves) const port = process.env.PORT || 2021 const host = process.env.HOST || '127.0.0.1' app.listen(port, host, () =&amp;gt; { console.log(`Application started on ${host}:${port}`) }) ``` *** ### Front-end I think using pure HTML is a mistake and I would prefer something like Angular for the web applications but that comes with its own learning process which can make this tutorial complex. So my recommendation is to learn something like Angular or Vue and live a happy life. Anyway, coding time. I'm not going to drop `index.html` here. It doesn't need much explanation and it's long. You can see it on the [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/mahdiyari/decentralized-game-on-hive/-/blob/master/front-end/index.html). I will just add some references here used in `app.js`. The table for listing the games and buttons for pagination. `index.html`: ``` Games list Auto updating every 5s # Game ID Player 1 Player 2 Starting Player Status Winner Action &amp;laquo; 1 &amp;raquo; ``` *** We have to fill the table above. So let's implement some basic functions. `js/app.js`: ``` const baseAPI = 'http://127.0.0.1:2021' const APICall = async (api) =&amp;gt; { return (await fetch(baseAPI + api)).json() } ``` For ease of use, we define a function for `GET` calls using `fetch` and a variable for our API address. *** ``` const getGames = async (page = 1) =&amp;gt; { const games = await APICall('/games/' + page) return games.games } ``` This function basically gets the games from the API per page. *** ``` const fillGamesTable = (data) =&amp;gt; { const tbody = document.getElementById('games-table-body') let temp = '' for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; data.length; i++) { temp += ` ${(gamesPage - 1) * 10 + i + 1} ${data[i].game_id} ${data[i].player1} ${data[i].player2} ${data[i].starting_player} ${data[i].status} ${data[i].winner} ` } if (data.length &amp;lt; 1) { temp = 'No games.' } tbody.innerHTML = temp } ``` `fillGamesTable` takes the result from `getGames` function and fills the HTML table with data using a `for` loop. *** ``` let gamesPage = 1 const loadTheGames = async () =&amp;gt; { const games = await getGames(gamesPage) fillGamesTable(games) if (games.length &amp;lt; 10) { document.getElementById('next-btn').className = 'page-item disabled' } else { document.getElementById('next-btn').className = 'page-item' } if (gamesPage === 1) { document.getElementById('prev-btn').className = 'page-item disabled' } else { document.getElementById('prev-btn').className = 'page-item' } document.getElementById('page-number').innerHTML = ` ${gamesPage} ` } loadTheGames() setInterval(() =&amp;gt; loadTheGames(), 5000) ``` With this function, we call the two previously defined functions to do their job and update the pagination buttons and the page number every time we update the table data. Also, every 5 seconds, it gets new data from API and updates the table with new data so users don't have to reload the page for new data. *** ``` const nextGamesPage = () =&amp;gt; { gamesPage++ loadTheGames() } const prevGamesPage = () =&amp;gt; { gamesPage-- loadTheGames() } ``` And two functions for changing pages. Simple as that. *** The final result with dummy data looks like this on the browser: ![Capture.PNG](https://images.hive.blog/DQmcYZC1vixajRW4Ui5dHiSfTy5MYqEYZhXy2bd2ituz4Ar/Capture.PNG) *** That's it for this part. I'm really happy with the results we are getting. I didn't plan anything beforehand and I'm coding as I'm writing the posts. Today we made 3 API calls and created the basic front-end which for now only shows the list of games that are submitted to the Hive blockchain. In the next part, we will implement the methods for creating and joining the games on the client side. We also probably need to create a game page where actual gaming happens. Thanks for reading.

I have been involved (voluntarily) with the development of the Condenser &amp;amp; Wallet apps (that are powering https://hive.blog and https://wallet.hive.blog) for quite a while now. There are other great frontends to Hive out there such as https://peakd.com and https://ecency.com but I have always been more or less faithful with the Condenser.

This is a regular report on my new contributions.

*Some of the new work below might still be in test and not yet deployed.*

## Display a message when community search does not return any result
@inertia raised [this issue](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/issues/123) where searching for a non-existing community would not refresh the current list of communities which is not an ideal experience as tit is more useful to display a message that tells the user that the searched keywords does not have any matching results.

![Community search](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/uploads/d62922fd5986b9b2741360b62480e92f/Screen_Shot_2021-03-30_at_10.06.23_pm.jpg)

Merge request: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/merge_requests/225

## Fix the search functionality
Recently, the search on this blog was broken. The page just kept displaying a spinning loading indicator but results were never displayed. Several users have raised the issue as it is an important feature. I've had a look and fixed it and took the opportunity to also add the ability to sort results by newest, popularity or relevance. Later on, I will add more advanced search such as search of posts from a specific user and tag.

With all of the recent scams and phishing websites here on HIVE the topic of recovery accounts has come up again. A lot of people still have there recovery account set to @steem or the account, which created their account e.g. @esteemapp or @blocktrades.

Setting the recovery account to a HIVE account you trust is really important in case someone is taking over your account. Otherwise all your hardly earned HIVE will be lost and there is no way of recovering it. When choosing a recovery account it is important you choose someone you trust and someone, who can identify you.

---

I myself use another account I created as my recovery account. The keys of the account are locked away and not easily accessible by an attacker. But this may not be the best solution for everyone. In particular I have set @recovery.hive as the recovery account for @primersion and @primersion as the recovery account for @recovery.hive.

The only way an attacker would be able to steal all of my funds would be to gain access to the keys for both accounts and if this should happen, it is my own fault ;)

---

Changing your recovery account is quite easy. You can use tools like the one created by @arcange [over here](https://tools.hivechain.app/recovery/) or the one created by @reazuliqbal you will find [over here](https://reazuliqbal.com/HiveAccountRecovery/) or change it directly on [peakd.com](https://peakd.com) under your Account Settings -&amp;gt; Keys &amp;amp; Permissions. Or you may use this small python script I wrote:

```
#!/usr/bin/python3

from beem import Hive
from beem.nodelist import NodeList
from beem.account import Account

nodelist = NodeList()
nodelist.update_nodes()
nodes = nodelist.get_hive_nodes()

account_name = input(&quot;Enter your account name: &quot;)
owner_key = input(&quot;Enter your private owner key: &quot;)
new_recovery_account = input(&quot;Enter new recovery account: &quot;)

hive = Hive(node=nodes, keys=[owner_key])
account = Account(account_name, blockchain_instance=hive)
account.change_recovery_account(new_recovery_account)

print(&quot;Successfully changed recovery account&quot;)
```

You have to enter your account name and private owner key and the new recovery account and the script does the rest for you. Please be careful when using the script and when pasting your private owner key.

---

In addition to that I wrote a small script for recovering your account (if you are using another of your accounts as a recovery account for your main account). The script is based on the information provided [here for Steem](https://developers.steem.io/tutorials-python/account_recovery) and was adapted for HIVE:

You will have to enter the account to be recovered, a recent password of the account and a new password for the account. For the actual recovery account you have to enter the account name and the private active key of the account. The remaining stuff like creating the account recovery request, recovering the account and updating the account data will be done by the script.

##### Please update your recovery account right now if you still have it set to @steem

Which account are you using as your recovery account, someone you trust or just some well-known and trustworthy account?

A lot of people still have there recovery account set to @steem or the account, which created their account e.g. @esteemapp or @blocktrades. Setting the recovery account to a HIVE account you trust is really important in case someone is taking over your account. Otherwise all your hardly earned HIVE will be lost and there is no way of recovering it. When choosing a recovery account it is important you choose someone you trust and someone, who can identify you. --- I myself use another account I created as my recovery account. The keys of the account are locked away and not easily accessible by an attacker. But this may not be the best solution for everyone. In particular I have set @recovery.hive as the recovery account for @primersion and @primersion as the recovery account for @recovery.hive. The only way an attacker would be able to steal all of my funds would be to gain access to the keys for both accounts and if this should happen, it is my own fault ;) --- Changing your recovery account is quite easy. You can use tools like the one created by @arcange [over here](https://tools.hivechain.app/recovery/) or the one created by @reazuliqbal you will find [over here](https://reazuliqbal.com/HiveAccountRecovery/) or change it directly on [peakd.com](https://peakd.com) under your Account Settings -&amp;gt; Keys &amp;amp; Permissions. Or you may use this small python script I wrote: ``` #!/usr/bin/python3 from beem import Hive from beem.nodelist import NodeList from beem.account import Account nodelist = NodeList() nodelist.update_nodes() nodes = nodelist.get_hive_nodes() account_name = input(&quot;Enter your account name: &quot;) owner_key = input(&quot;Enter your private owner key: &quot;) new_recovery_account = input(&quot;Enter new recovery account: &quot;) hive = Hive(node=nodes, keys=[owner_key]) account = Account(account_name, blockchain_instance=hive) account.change_recovery_account(new_recovery_account) print(&quot;Successfully changed recovery account&quot;) ``` You have to enter your account name and private owner key and the new recovery account and the script does the rest for you. Please be careful when using the script and when pasting your private owner key. --- In addition to that I wrote a small script for recovering your account (if you are using another of your accounts as a recovery account for your main account). The script is based on the information provided [here for Steem](https://developers.steem.io/tutorials-python/account_recovery) and was adapted for HIVE: ``` #!/usr/bin/python3 import beembase from beem.account import Account from beem import Hive from beem.transactionbuilder import TransactionBuilder from beemgraphenebase.account import PasswordKey from beembase.objects import Permission from beem.nodelist import NodeList # acquire hive node list nodelist = NodeList() nodelist.update_nodes() nodes = nodelist.get_hive_nodes() # capture user information username = input('account to be recovered: ') old_password = input('recent password for account: ') new_password = input('new password for account: ') recovery_account = input('account owner (recovery account): ') recovery_account_private_key = input('account owner private ACTIVE key: ') # create new account owner keys new_account_owner_private_key = PasswordKey(username, new_password, role='owner').get_private_key() new_account_owner_private_key_string = str(new_account_owner_private_key) new_account_owner_public_key = str(new_account_owner_private_key.pubkey) # create old account owner keys old_account_owner_private_key = PasswordKey(username, old_password, role='owner').get_private_key() old_account_owner_private_key_string = str(old_account_owner_private_key) old_account_owner_public_key = str(old_account_owner_private_key.pubkey) new_owner_authority = { &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [new_account_owner_public_key, 1] ], &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1 } # recovery request data object creation request_op_data = { 'account_to_recover': username, 'recovery_account': recovery_account, 'new_owner_authority': new_owner_authority, 'extensions': [] } # recovery request operation creation request_op = beembase.operations.Request_account_recovery(**request_op_data) print('request_op_data') print(request_op_data) # recovery request broadcast hive = Hive(node=nodes, keys=[recovery_account_private_key]) request_result = hive.finalizeOp(request_op, recovery_account, &quot;active&quot;) print('request_result') print(request_result) recent_owner_authority = { &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [old_account_owner_public_key, 1] ], &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1 } op_recover_account_data = { 'account_to_recover': username, 'new_owner_authority': new_owner_authority, 'recent_owner_authority': recent_owner_authority, 'extensions': [] } op_account_update_data = { &quot;account&quot;: username, &quot;active&quot;: { &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [str(PasswordKey(username, new_password, role='active').get_private_key().pubkey), 1] ], &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1 }, &quot;posting&quot;: { &quot;key_auths&quot;: [ [str(PasswordKey(username, new_password, role='posting').get_private_key().pubkey), 1] ], &quot;account_auths&quot;: [], &quot;weight_threshold&quot;: 1 }, &quot;memo_key&quot;: str(PasswordKey(username, new_password, role='memo').get_private_key().pubkey), &quot;json_metadata&quot;: &quot;&quot; } op_recover_account = beembase.operations.Recover_account(**op_recover_account_data) print('op_recover_account') print(op_recover_account) tb = TransactionBuilder(blockchain_instance=hive) tb.appendOps([op_recover_account]) tb.appendWif(str(old_account_owner_private_key)) tb.appendWif(str(new_account_owner_private_key)) tb.sign() result = tb.broadcast() print('result') print(result) op_account_update = beembase.operations.Account_update(**op_account_update_data) print('op_account_update') print(op_account_update) hive = Hive(node=nodes, keys=[new_account_owner_private_key]) tb = TransactionBuilder(blockchain_instance=hive) tb.appendOps([op_account_update]) tb.appendWif(str(new_account_owner_private_key)) tb.sign() result = tb.broadcast() print('result') print(result) ``` You will have to enter the account to be recovered, a recent password of the account and a new password for the account.

This part took a little longer because it was actually time-consuming (also I took a little break). The process is getting harder so it might take a few days longer than expected for the coming parts but I will do my best.

In the previous parts, we made a simple front-end with login functionality and initialized our API and back-end application with streaming. ([Part1](https://hive.blog/hive-139531/@mahdiyari/making-a-decentralized-game-on-hive-tic-tac-toe-part-1) and [Part2](https://hive.blog/hive-139531/@mahdiyari/making-a-decentralized-game-on-hive-part-2))
## MySQL Setup
You can use apps like [AMPPS](https://www.ampps.com/) which comes with MySQL and other tools like PHPMyAdmin (one of the best MySQL management apps) or install MySQL directly. I have AMMPS on windows and use MySQL docker on Linux. 

MySQL docker installation:
```
docker pull mysql/mysql-server:latest
```
I create a folder `/root/mysql-docker1` and put the MySQL config file there `my.cnf` and another folder `data` for holding the database files.
Running on port `127.0.0.1:3306`:
```
docker run --name=mysql1 \
--mount type=bind,src=/root/mysql-docker1/my.cnf,dst=/etc/my.cnf \
--mount type=bind,src=/root/mysql-docker1/data,dst=/var/lib/mysql \
-p 127.0.0.1:3306:3306 -d mysql/mysql-server:latest
```
There are different ways to tune your MySQL server based on your hardware which I'm not going to talk about. The following config is for medium-range hardware (32GB ram).
`my.cnf`:
```
[mysqld]
skip_name_resolve

table_open_cache_instances      = 64
open_files_limit                = 100000 # UPD
```
Note: restart MySQL server after updating the`my.cnf` file.

MySQL password on AMMPS is `mysql` and on docker setup, I think you get the password from `docker logs mysql1`. Anyway, there are many documentations about MySQL already on the internet.

Create a database `tictactoe`. It's easier with tools like PHPMyAdmin if you are using AMPPS. Or try HeidiSQL.
Here is the SQL command for creating the database:
```
CREATE DATABASE `tictactoe`;
```
***
## Development
Let's create a config file for holding MySQL login information for our app. I will put this file as `config.example.js` in repository and you have to rename it manually.
`config.js`:
```
const config = {
  dbName: 'tictactoe',
  dbUser: 'root',
  dbPassword: 'password',
  dbHost: '127.0.0.1',
  dbPort: 3306
}

module.exports = config
```
***
I have a personal code for MySQL connection pooling. It simply makes a custom async function just like the original connect function of [mysqljs](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql) library but for pooling connections.
`helpers/mysql.js`:
```
const mysql = require('mysql')
const config = require('../config')
const pool = mysql.createPool({
  connectionLimit: 5,
  host: config.dbHost,
  port: config.dbPort,
  user: config.dbUser,
  password: config.dbPassword,
  database: config.dbName,
  charset: 'utf8mb4'
})

// Rewriting MySQL query method as a promise
const con = {}
con.query = async (query, val) =&amp;gt; {
  if (val) {
    const qu = await new Promise((resolve, reject) =&amp;gt; {
      pool.query(query, val, (error, results) =&amp;gt; {
        if (error) reject(new Error(error))
        resolve(results)
      })
    })
    return qu
  } else {
    const qu = await new Promise((resolve, reject) =&amp;gt; {
      pool.query(query, (error, results) =&amp;gt; {
        if (error) reject(new Error(error))
        resolve(results)
      })
    })
    return qu
  }
}

module.exports = con
```
It creates a pool of 5 connections which is more than enough for our game.
And of course:
```
npm install mysql
```
***
#### Initializing database
We make a function to create necessary tables if they don't exist already.
`helpers/initDatabase.js`:
```
const mysql = require('./mysql')

/**
 * id, game_id, player1, player2, starting_player, status, winner
 */
const tableGames =
  'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `tictactoe`.`games` ( `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , ' +
  '`game_id` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , ' +
  '`player1` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , `player2` TINYTEXT NULL DEFAULT NULL , ' +
  '`starting_player` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , `status` TINYTEXT NULL , ' +
  '`winner` TINYTEXT NULL DEFAULT NULL , PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)) ' +
  'ENGINE = InnoDB CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;'

/**
 * id, game_id, player, col, row
 */
const tableMoves =
  'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `tictactoe`.`moves` ( `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , ' +
  '`game_id` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , `player` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , ' +
  '`col` INT(1) NOT NULL , `row` INT(1) NOT NULL , ' +
  'PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)) ENGINE = InnoDB CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;'

const tableRquests =
  'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `tictactoe`.`requests` ( `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , ' +
  '`game_id` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , `player` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , `status` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , ' +
  'PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)) ENGINE = InnoDB CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;'

const initDatabase = async () =&amp;gt; {
  await mysql.query(tableGames)
  await mysql.query(tableMoves)
  await mysql.query(tableRquests)
}

module.exports = initDatabase
```

#### Created tables
`games`
&lt;center&gt;![tablesqlgames.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmVCMyNZax6xd6kCc2VZijGjMa9Qbt8Myeev7jF8KmcqXe/image.png)&lt;/center&gt;

`moves`
&lt;center&gt;![tablesqlmoves.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmVwyDZg1N3KEteDgfA5NdMHeUkjpngHZEmizBXxhh3XPs/image.png)&lt;/center&gt;

`requests`
&lt;center&gt;![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQLxfwKEfWSQ614vWb6qfUNVMSyiFgnKEh5nSWcKYFQQv/image.png)&lt;/center&gt;
***
#### Updating main application
Now we can complete the game methods in `index.js`:
`createGame`
```
const createGame = async (data, user) =&amp;gt; {
  if (!data || !data.id || !data.starting_player) {
    return
  }
  // validating
  if (
    data.id.length !== 20 ||
    (data.starting_player !== 'first' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.starting_player !== 'second')
  ) {
    return
  }
  // Check already existing games
  const duplicate = await mysql.query(
    'SELECT `id` FROM `games` WHERE `game_id`= ?',
    [data.id]
  )
  if (duplicate &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Array.isArray(duplicate) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; duplicate.length &amp;gt; 0) {
    return
  }
  // Add game to database
  await mysql.query(
    'INSERT INTO `games`(`game_id`, `player1`, `starting_player`, `status`) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)',
    [data.id, user, data.starting_player, 'waiting']
  )
}
```
***
`requestJoin`
```
const requestJoin = async (data, user) =&amp;gt; {
  if (!data || !data.id || !data.id.length !== 20) {
    return
  }
  // Check game id in database
  const game = await mysql.query(
    'SELECT `player1` FROM `games` WHERE `game_id`= ? AND `status`= ?',
    [data.id, 'waiting']
  )
  if (!game || !Array.isArray(game) || game.length &amp;lt; 1) {
    return
  }
  // Players can not play with themselves
  if (game[0].player1 === user) {
    return
  }
  // Check already open requests
  const requests = await mysql.query(
    'SELECT `id` FROM `requests` WHERE `game_id`= ? AND (`player`= ? OR `status`= ?)',
    [data.id, user, 'accepted']
  )
  if (requests &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Array.isArray(requests) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; requests.length &amp;gt; 0) {
    return
  }

  await mysql.query(
    'INSERT INTO `requests`(`game_id`, `player`, `status`) VALUES (?, ?, ?)',
    [data.id, user, 'waiting']
  )
}
```
***
`acceptRequest`
```
const acceptRequest = async (data, user) =&amp;gt; {
  if (!data || !data.id || !data.player || !data.id.length !== 20) {
    return
  }
  // Validate game in database
  const game = await mysql.query(
    'SELECT `player1` FROM `games` WHERE `game_id`= ? AND `status`= ?',
    [data.id, 'waiting']
  )
  if (!game || !Array.isArray(game) || game.length &amp;lt; 1) {
    return
  }
  const requests = await mysql.query(
    'SELECT `id` FROM `requests` WHERE `game_id`= ? AND `player`= ? AND `status`= ?',

    return
  }
  // Accept the join request and update game status
  await mysql.query(
    'UPDATE `games` SET `player2`=?,`status`=? WHERE `game_id`=?',
    [data.player, 'running', data.id]
  )
  await mysql.query(
    'UPDATE `requests` SET `status`=? WHERE `game_id`=? AND `player`=?',
    ['accepted', data.id, data.player]
  )
}
```
***
Some updates to `processData`:
```
const processData = (jsonData, postingAuths) =&amp;gt; {
  try {
    if (!jsonData) {
      return
    }
    const data = JSON.parse(jsonData)
    if (!data || !data.action || !data.app) {
      return
    }
    if (
      !postingAuths ||
      !Array.isArray(postingAuths) ||
      postingAuths.length &amp;lt; 1
    ) {
      return
    }
    const user = postingAuths[0]
    if (data.action === 'create_game') {
      createGame(data, user)
    } else if (data.action === 'request_join') {
      requestJoin(data, user)
    } else if (data.action === 'accept_request') {
      acceptRequest(data, user)
    } else if (data.action === 'play') {
      play(data, user)
    }
  } catch (e) {
    // error might be on JSON.parse and wrong json format
    return null
  }
}
```
And streaming function:
```
try {
  stream.streamBlockOperations((ops) =&amp;gt; {
    if (ops) {
      const op = ops[0]
      if (op &amp;amp;&amp;amp; op[0] === 'custom_json' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; op[1].id === 'tictactoe') {
        processData(op[1].json, op[1].required_posting_auths)
      }
    }
  })
} catch (e) {
  throw new Error(e)
}
```

I think it's enough for this part. Let's finish before I sleep on the keyboard.

We set up the MySQL server and made a script to create 3 tables. Our back-end is now processing data into the database and 3 main functions are working as expected. Creating a game, Requesting to join a game, and accepting the requests.

We have to create the front-end for these functions in the next part. I think the hard part is going to be the `play` function which holds the game rules.

The process is getting harder so it might take a few days longer than expected for the coming parts but I will do my best. In the previous parts, we made a simple front-end with login functionality and initialized our API and back-end application with streaming. ([Part1](https://hive.blog/hive-139531/@mahdiyari/making-a-decentralized-game-on-hive-tic-tac-toe-part-1) and [Part2](https://hive.blog/hive-139531/@mahdiyari/making-a-decentralized-game-on-hive-part-2)) ## MySQL Setup You can use apps like [AMPPS](https://www.ampps.com/) which comes with MySQL and other tools like PHPMyAdmin (one of the best MySQL management apps) or install MySQL directly. I have AMMPS on windows and use MySQL docker on Linux. MySQL docker installation: ``` docker pull mysql/mysql-server:latest ``` I create a folder `/root/mysql-docker1` and put the MySQL config file there `my.cnf` and another folder `data` for holding the database files. Running on port `127.0.0.1:3306`: ``` docker run --name=mysql1 \ --mount type=bind,src=/root/mysql-docker1/my.cnf,dst=/etc/my.cnf \ --mount type=bind,src=/root/mysql-docker1/data,dst=/var/lib/mysql \ -p 127.0.0.1:3306:3306 -d mysql/mysql-server:latest ``` There are different ways to tune your MySQL server based on your hardware which I'm not going to talk about. The following config is for medium-range hardware (32GB ram). `my.cnf`: ``` [mysqld] skip_name_resolve user=mysql default_authentication_plugin = mysql_native_password symbolic-links=0 character_set_server=utf8mb4 collation_server=utf8mb4_general_ci innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct = 90 innodb_max_dirty_pages_pct_lwm = 10 innodb_flush_neighbors = 0 innodb_undo_log_truncate=off max_connect_errors = 1000000 # InnoDB Settings innodb_file_per_table innodb_log_files_in_group = 2 innodb_open_files = 4000 default_storage_engine = InnoDB innodb_buffer_pool_instances = 8 # Use 1 instance per 1GB of InnoDB pool size innodb_buffer_pool_size = 16G # Use up to 70-80% of RAM innodb_flush_method = O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC innodb_log_buffer_size = 64M innodb_log_file_size = 10G innodb_stats_on_metadata = 0 # tune innodb_doublewrite= 1 innodb_thread_concurrency = 0 innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 0 innodb_lru_scan_depth = 2048 innodb_page_cleaners = 4 join_buffer_size = 256K sort_buffer_size = 256K innodb_use_native_aio = 1 innodb_stats_persistent = 1 innodb_adaptive_flushing = 1 innodb_read_io_threads = 16 innodb_write_io_threads = 16 innodb_io_capacity = 1500 innodb_io_capacity_max = 2500 innodb_purge_threads = 4 innodb_adaptive_hash_index = 0 max_prepared_stmt_count = 1000000 innodb_monitor_enable = '%' performance_schema = ON key_buffer_size = 512M # Connection Settings max_connections = 2000 # UPD back_log = 3000 interactive_timeout = 180 wait_timeout = 10 table_open_cache = 200000 # UPD table_open_cache_instances = 64 open_files_limit = 100000 # UPD ``` Note: restart MySQL server after updating the`my.cnf` file. MySQL password on AMMPS is `mysql` and on docker setup, I think you get the password from `docker logs mysql1`. Anyway, there are many documentations about MySQL already on the internet. Create a database `tictactoe`. It's easier with tools like PHPMyAdmin if you are using AMPPS. Or try HeidiSQL. Here is the SQL command for creating the database: ``` CREATE DATABASE `tictactoe`; ``` *** ## Development Let's create a config file for holding MySQL login information for our app. I will put this file as `config.example.js` in repository and you have to rename it manually. `config.js`: ``` const config = { dbName: 'tictactoe', dbUser: 'root', dbPassword: 'password', dbHost: '127.0.0.1', dbPort: 3306 } module.exports = config ``` *** I have a personal code for MySQL connection pooling. It simply makes a custom async function just like the original connect function of [mysqljs](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql) library but for pooling connections. `helpers/mysql.js`: ``` const mysql = require('mysql') const config = require('../config') const pool = mysql.createPool({ connectionLimit: 5, host: config.dbHost, port: config.dbPort, user: config.dbUser, password: config.dbPassword, database: config.dbName, charset: 'utf8mb4' }) // Rewriting MySQL query method as a promise const con = {} con.query = async (query, val) =&amp;gt; { if (val) { const qu = await new Promise((resolve, reject) =&amp;gt; { pool.query(query, val, (error, results) =&amp;gt; { if (error) reject(new Error(error)) resolve(results) }) }) return qu } else { const qu = await new Promise((resolve, reject) =&amp;gt; { pool.query(query, (error, results) =&amp;gt; { if (error) reject(new Error(error)) resolve(results) }) }) return qu } } module.exports = con ``` It creates a pool of 5 connections which is more than enough for our game. And of course: ``` npm install mysql ``` *** #### Initializing database We make a function to create necessary tables if they don't exist already. `helpers/initDatabase.js`: ``` const mysql = require('./mysql') /** * id, game_id, player1, player2, starting_player, status, winner */ const tableGames = 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `tictactoe`.`games` ( `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , ' + '`game_id` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , ' + '`player1` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , `player2` TINYTEXT NULL DEFAULT NULL , ' + '`starting_player` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , `status` TINYTEXT NULL , ' + '`winner` TINYTEXT NULL DEFAULT NULL , PRIMARY KEY (`id`)) ' + 'ENGINE = InnoDB CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;' /** * id, game_id, player, col, row */ const tableMoves = 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `tictactoe`.`moves` ( `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , ' + '`game_id` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , `player` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , ' + '`col` INT(1) NOT NULL , `row` INT(1) NOT NULL , ' + 'PRIMARY KEY (`id`)) ENGINE = InnoDB CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;' const tableRquests = 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `tictactoe`.`requests` ( `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT , ' + '`game_id` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , `player` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , `status` TINYTEXT NOT NULL , ' + 'PRIMARY KEY (`id`)) ENGINE = InnoDB CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;' const initDatabase = async () =&amp;gt; { await mysql.query(tableGames) await mysql.query(tableMoves) await mysql.query(tableRquests) } module.exports = initDatabase ``` #### Created tables `games` ![tablesqlgames.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmVCMyNZax6xd6kCc2VZijGjMa9Qbt8Myeev7jF8KmcqXe/image.png) `moves` ![tablesqlmoves.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmVwyDZg1N3KEteDgfA5NdMHeUkjpngHZEmizBXxhh3XPs/image.png) `requests` ![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQLxfwKEfWSQ614vWb6qfUNVMSyiFgnKEh5nSWcKYFQQv/image.png) *** #### Updating main application Now we can complete the game methods in `index.js`: `createGame` ``` const createGame = async (data, user) =&amp;gt; { if (!data || !data.id || !data.starting_player) { return } // validating if ( data.id.length !== 20 || (data.starting_player !== 'first' &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.starting_player !== 'second') ) { return } // Check already existing games const duplicate = await mysql.query( 'SELECT `id` FROM `games` WHERE `game_id`= ?', [data.id] ) if (duplicate &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Array.isArray(duplicate) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; duplicate.length &amp;gt; 0) { return } // Add game to database await mysql.query( 'INSERT INTO `games`(`game_id`, `player1`, `starting_player`, `status`) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)', [data.id, user, data.starting_player, 'waiting'] ) } ``` *** `requestJoin` ``` const requestJoin = async (data, user) =&amp;gt; { if (!data || !data.id || !data.id.length !== 20) { return } // Check game id in database const game = await mysql.query( 'SELECT `player1` FROM `games` WHERE `game_id`= ?

AND (`player`= ?

One of Hive blockchain's powerful features is its custom_json operation. Normally, users don't even see and hear about this operations. However, this operation enables developers to store their game or web application data on the Hive blockchain. If you would like to know more about what is stored in Hive blocks and and curious about various Hive operations, feel free to read my [Exploring Hive Blocks](https://leofinance.io/@geekgirl/exploring-hive-blocks) post.

In this post I would like to share how to broadcast custom_json operations to Hive blockchain, how to retrieve them afterwards using Beem module in Python. Beem is a python module created by @holger80, and makes is easy to connect to Hive blockchain and interact with it using python programming language.

Custom_json is one of many operations of Hive. It allow developers to store game or applications data on Hive blockchain. Data is stored as text in Json format. Sine Json is a native JavaScript format and widely used in website and web applications, Hive makes it super easy to create Apps and Games that would like to use decentralized solutions.

&lt;center&gt;**Broadcasting a Transaction to Hive Blockchain**&lt;/center&gt;

Every Hive block has a size limit of 65536 bytes. Which means we can only store 65536 characters including all the properties in one block. I believe this is a parameters that witnesses can change if they wish to based on demand, infrastructure, scaling, etc. For now and foreseeable future this is the limitation every developer of apps and games should consider.

Another limitation is each custom_json operation is limited to 8192 bytes or characters. However, it is possible to broadcast multiple operations within a transaction. We face another limitation there. We can only broadcast 5 operations within a transaction by the broadcasting account. 

Before we get to the code, another thing to keep in mind is, once transaction is built and we broadcast it, the return value doesn't not give the block number where the transaction is stored. That is because when we broadcast with python we don't wait until the block is produced. A couple minutes after broadcasting the transaction the block is produced and available for us to retrieve the data stored. When we broadcast we get back values like `expiration`, `ref_block_num` and `ref_block_prefix`. Using these three values we can find our transaction and the block it is stored in. So that we don't search the entire blockchain form the beginning, I also decided to store the current block number before broadcasting. That way I can start searching for the transaction starting from that block number.

Following is the code to broadcast custom_json operations:

```
from beem.transactionbuilder import TransactionBuilder
from beembase.operations import Custom_json
from beem import Hive
from beem.blockchain import Blockchain 
from beem.block import Block
from helper import wif, name 
from beem.nodelist import NodeList
from pprint import pprint

nodelist = NodeList()
nodelist.update_nodes()
nodes = nodelist.get_hive_nodes()

hive = Hive(node=nodes, nobroadcast=False, keys={'posting': wif})
blockchain = Blockchain(hive)
current_block_num = blockchain.get_current_block_num()

tx = TransactionBuilder(blockchain_instance=hive)

for i in range(1,6):
  txt = str(i) * 8100
  data = {}
  data['data'] = txt
  cj = {
      &quot;required_auths&quot;: [],
      &quot;required_posting_auths&quot;: [name],
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;librarian&quot;,
      &quot;json&quot;: data
    }
  tx.appendOps(Custom_json(cj))

tx.appendWif(wif)
signed_tx = tx.sign()
broadcast_tx = tx.broadcast()

print(current_block_num)
print(broadcast_tx)
```

Main thing to pay attention to is the TransactionBuilder. It allows us to build a transaction before broadcasting then broadcast it. I stored Hive account name and keys in a separate python file named helper.py, and imported variables name and wif to sign the transaction. To broadcast a this transaction posting key was enough.

We can add upto 5 operations in our transaction using .appendOps() method. Everything else should be self-explanatory. Feel free to ask in the comments if something doesn't make sense. I will be happy to explain each line.

Now the last two print statements show the block number before the transaction was broadcasted, and return values after the broadcast happened. 

Now we need to retrieve the data from Hive. We will use the printed or stored block number to start the search from and values returned when we broadcasted the transactions such as `expiration`,  `ref_block_num`, and `ref_block_prefix`. 

```
from beem import Hive
from beem.block import Block
from pprint import pprint
from beem.blockchain import Blockchain
from beem.nodelist import NodeList

nodelist = NodeList()
nodelist.update_nodes()
nodes = nodelist.get_hive_nodes()
hive = Hive(node=nodes)

start_block_num = 52374262
blockchain = Blockchain(hive)
end_block_num = blockchain.get_current_block_num()

exp = '2021-03-23T02:08:41'
rbn = 10998
rbp = 3231133325

def get_data(start, end, exp, rbn, rbp):
    ref = []
    for num in range(start, end):
        block = Block(block=num, blockchain_instance=hive)
        b = block.json()
        for i, tr in enumerate(b['transactions']):
            if tr['expiration'] == exp and tr['ref_block_num'] == rbn and tr['ref_block_prefix'] == rbp:
                print(i)
                print(b['id'])
                print(b['timestamp'])
                print(tr['operations'])
                print(b['transaction_ids'][i])
                ref.append(b['id'])
                ref.append(i)
                return ref

ref = get_data(start_block_num, end_block_num, exp, rbn, rbp)

print('-----')
print(ref)
bb = Block(block=ref[0])
bb = bb.json()
bb = bb['transactions'][ref[1]]
bb = bb['operations'][0]['value']['json']

print(bb)

```

What the code above does is, it searches for the stored transaction with custom_json operations starting with the nearest known block numbers. Once found it displays the data we are searching for. It also provides the block number the transaction is stored at. 

Now, we want to store this block number as reference for future use. Next time we need the same data, we can just get the block from the blockchain instead of iterating through multiple blocks and save us time.

If we have the block number, then we can easily get everything stored in that block as following:

```
block_num = 52374284

block = Block(block=block_num, blockchain_instance=hive)
b = block.json()

pprint(b)
```

One last thing I would like to share has to do with resource credits. I used an account with 1006 HP to test the codes above. The transaction above had 5 operations with 8100 characters each in size. It only took less than 1% of resource credits for this account to broadcast the transaction.

I hope you find this post useful. Let me know your thoughts. Also, let me know if there are better ways of broadcasting transactions and retrieving data from Hive blockchain using python.

Normally, users don't even see and hear about this operations. However, this operation enables developers to store their game or web application data on the Hive blockchain. If you would like to know more about what is stored in Hive blocks and and curious about various Hive operations, feel free to read my [Exploring Hive Blocks](https://leofinance.io/@geekgirl/exploring-hive-blocks) post. In this post I would like to share how to broadcast custom_json operations to Hive blockchain, how to retrieve them afterwards using Beem module in Python. Beem is a python module created by @holger80, and makes is easy to connect to Hive blockchain and interact with it using python programming language. Custom_json is one of many operations of Hive. It allow developers to store game or applications data on Hive blockchain. Data is stored as text in Json format. Sine Json is a native JavaScript format and widely used in website and web applications, Hive makes it super easy to create Apps and Games that would like to use decentralized solutions. **Broadcasting a Transaction to Hive Blockchain** Every Hive block has a size limit of 65536 bytes. Which means we can only store 65536 characters including all the properties in one block. I believe this is a parameters that witnesses can change if they wish to based on demand, infrastructure, scaling, etc. For now and foreseeable future this is the limitation every developer of apps and games should consider. Another limitation is each custom_json operation is limited to 8192 bytes or characters. However, it is possible to broadcast multiple operations within a transaction. We face another limitation there. We can only broadcast 5 operations within a transaction by the broadcasting account. Before we get to the code, another thing to keep in mind is, once transaction is built and we broadcast it, the return value doesn't not give the block number where the transaction is stored. That is because when we broadcast with python we don't wait until the block is produced. A couple minutes after broadcasting the transaction the block is produced and available for us to retrieve the data stored. When we broadcast we get back values like `expiration`, `ref_block_num` and `ref_block_prefix`. Using these three values we can find our transaction and the block it is stored in. So that we don't search the entire blockchain form the beginning, I also decided to store the current block number before broadcasting. That way I can start searching for the transaction starting from that block number. Following is the code to broadcast custom_json operations: ``` from beem.transactionbuilder import TransactionBuilder from beembase.operations import Custom_json from beem import Hive from beem.blockchain import Blockchain from beem.block import Block from helper import wif, name from beem.nodelist import NodeList from pprint import pprint nodelist = NodeList() nodelist.update_nodes() nodes = nodelist.get_hive_nodes() hive = Hive(node=nodes, nobroadcast=False, keys={'posting': wif}) blockchain = Blockchain(hive) current_block_num = blockchain.get_current_block_num() tx = TransactionBuilder(blockchain_instance=hive) for i in range(1,6): txt = str(i) * 8100 data = {} data['data'] = txt cj = { &quot;required_auths&quot;: [], &quot;required_posting_auths&quot;: [name], &quot;id&quot;: &quot;librarian&quot;, &quot;json&quot;: data } tx.appendOps(Custom_json(cj)) tx.appendWif(wif) signed_tx = tx.sign() broadcast_tx = tx.broadcast() print(current_block_num) print(broadcast_tx) ``` Main thing to pay attention to is the TransactionBuilder. It allows us to build a transaction before broadcasting then broadcast it. I stored Hive account name and keys in a separate python file named helper.py, and imported variables name and wif to sign the transaction. To broadcast a this transaction posting key was enough. We can add upto 5 operations in our transaction using .appendOps() method. Everything else should be self-explanatory. Feel free to ask in the comments if something doesn't make sense. I will be happy to explain each line. Now the last two print statements show the block number before the transaction was broadcasted, and return values after the broadcast happened. Now we need to retrieve the data from Hive. We will use the printed or stored block number to start the search from and values returned when we broadcasted the transactions such as `expiration`, `ref_block_num`, and `ref_block_prefix`. ``` from beem import Hive from beem.block import Block from pprint import pprint from beem.blockchain import Blockchain from beem.nodelist import NodeList nodelist = NodeList() nodelist.update_nodes() nodes = nodelist.get_hive_nodes() hive = Hive(node=nodes) start_block_num = 52374262 blockchain = Blockchain(hive) end_block_num = blockchain.get_current_block_num() exp = '2021-03-23T02:08:41' rbn = 10998 rbp = 3231133325 def get_data(start, end, exp, rbn, rbp): ref = [] for num in range(start, end): block = Block(block=num, blockchain_instance=hive) b = block.json() for i, tr in enumerate(b['transactions']): if tr['expiration'] == exp and tr['ref_block_num'] == rbn and tr['ref_block_prefix'] == rbp: print(i) print(b['id']) print(b['timestamp']) print(tr['operations']) print(b['transaction_ids'][i]) ref.append(b['id']) ref.append(i) return ref ref = get_data(start_block_num, end_block_num, exp, rbn, rbp) print('-----') print(ref) bb = Block(block=ref[0]) bb = bb.json() bb = bb['transactions'][ref[1]] bb = bb['operations'][0]['value']['json'] print(bb) ``` What the code above does is, it searches for the stored transaction with custom_json operations starting with the nearest known block numbers.
