We will develop a decentralized game by the end of this series. The goal is to make learning development on Hive blockchain easier by using a simple game as the training project.

## Target audience
Of course, it's not for everybody. I will try to keep it simple as possible for people with less experience with development. But some degree of understanding code is necessary to learn something. I will explain anything related to the Hive blockchain that we use.

You can find the links for the final result of this part at the end of this post.

## Why &quot;tic-tac-toe&quot;?
It's a simple multiplayer game and it covers most of the topics needed for a bigger decentralized game or application. Most people are already familiar with this game and it's easier to code and its rules are simple.

## Development
We will use Javascript for the game because it's simple enough so most people understand easily. The front-end will be pure HTML. Also, I think MySQL is a good fit as the database. The game needs a database to keep track of games and players. MySQL docker can be set up in a few minutes.

The decentralized game will work without depending on one central software. The game will talk only to the blockchain and there is no central database. It doesn't need a private entity to hold players' data. Anyone can run an interface for the game.

(We have a database but it's not a central private database and it can be synced through blockchain. Anyone should be able to run an instance of the game and the game will get the same exact database by reading data from the blockchain. It's like hivemind, the database that holds and serves most of the data on Hive.)

## Tools I'm using
- Visual Studio Code
- Nodejs
- MySQL docker setup
- Chrome browser

I didn't plan anything beforehand so I don't know how many posts it will take. I will list the things that come to my mind right now.

## Planning
- Front-end
  - Make a login method on the client-side
  - Display available games list
  - Create/Request to join a game
  - Design the game visuals and controls
- Back-end
  - Stream the blockchain and listen for custom_json operations
  - Define custom_json operations
  - Game mechanics
  - API to communicate with front-end
  - Replay/resync method to update the database on newly deployed game clients

The above list may or may not change. Anyway, let's start with the front-end and add a login method.
***
## Part 1: Front-end - Login method
I think the HTML part doesn't need any explanation. Page title, description, bootstrap navbar, and a login link. Added `css/style.css` and `js/app.js` too. When the user clicks on the &quot;login&quot; link, a modal with the login form will appear. It will then fire `login()` function on submit.

`index.html`:
```
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot; /&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;js/app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
``` 
***
### Styles
`css/style.css`:
```
.navbar-nav {
  margin-right: 30px;
}
.navbar-brand {
  margin-left: 30px;
}
#login-error {
  color: #e31337;
  display: none;
}
```
***
## Javascript
`js/app.js`
An object for user data.
```
const userData = {
  authorized: false,
  username: '',
  key: ''
}
```
Let's define the login function. It will verify the posting key and username then keep the data in localStorage. We use the [hive-tx](https://github.com/mahdiyari/hive-tx-js) library for converting keys.

```
const login = async () =&amp;gt; {
  const loginModal = bootstrap.Modal.getInstance(
    document.getElementById('login-modal')
  )
  const loginButtonForm = document.getElementById('login-form-btn')
  loginButtonForm.setAttribute('disabled', 'true')
  const loginError = document.getElementById('login-error')
  loginError.style.display = 'none'
  const username = document.getElementById('username').value
  const key = document.getElementById('posting-key').value
  const validate = await validatePostingKey(username, key)
  if (validate.result === 0) {
    loginError.innerHTML = validate.error
    loginError.style.display = 'block'
    loginButtonForm.removeAttribute('disabled')
    return
  }
  userData.authorized = true
  userData.username = username
  userData.key = key
  window.localStorage.setItem('userData', JSON.stringify(userData))
  loginButtonForm.removeAttribute('disabled')
  updateState()
  loginModal.hide()
}
```
As you can see there are 2 more functions used inside the login function. The first one is `validatePostingKey()`. It's a post for itself.
Let me explain it. First, we make a call to the Hive RPC API node by using hive-tx library and get the account information including the public posting key. Then we convert the user's private posting key to the public key and compare the two values. If the two values are equal then the user-provided private key is correct and we can authorize the user. There are also other ways to achieve the same result like signing a message with the private key and validating that signature with the public key.

```
const validatePostingKey = async (username, privateKey) =&amp;gt; {
  const accounts = await hiveTx.call('condenser_api.get_accounts', [[username]])
  if (
    !accounts ||
    !accounts.result ||
    !Array.isArray(accounts.result) ||
    accounts.result.length &amp;lt; 1
  ) {
    return { result: 0, error: 'Network error or wrong username' }
  }
  try {
    const account = accounts.result[0]
    const publicWif = account.posting.key_auths[0][0] || ''
    const generatedPublicKey = hiveTx.PrivateKey.from(privateKey)
      .createPublic()
      .toString()

    if (generatedPublicKey !== publicWif) {
      return { result: 0, error: 'Wrong key' }
    }
    return { result: 1 }
  } catch (e) {
    return { result: 0, error: 'Wrong key or network error' }
  }
}
```
updateState() is used to update the HTML interface after user login and logout.
```
const updateState = () =&amp;gt; {
  const loginButton = document.getElementById('login-button')
  const logoutMenu = document.getElementById('logout-menu')
  const usernameButton = document.getElementById('username-button')
  if (userData.authorized &amp;amp;&amp;amp; userData.username &amp;amp;&amp;amp; userData.key) {
    loginButton.style.display = 'none'
    logoutMenu.style.display = 'block'
    usernameButton.innerHTML = '@' + userData.username
  } else {
    loginButton.style.display = 'block'
    logoutMenu.style.display = 'none'
  }
}
```
And it's time for the logout function.
```
const logout = () =&amp;gt; {
  userData.authorized = false
  userData.username = ''
  userData.key = ''
  window.localStorage.removeItem('userData')
  updateState()
}
```
We need to check localStorage on the page reload and log in the user if the key is in the localStorage.
```
const checkState = () =&amp;gt; {
  const localData = window.localStorage.getItem('userData')
  let data
  if (!localData) {
    return
  }
  try {
    data = JSON.parse(localData)
  } catch (e) {
    data = userData
  }
  if (data.authorized &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.username &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.key) {
    userData.authorized = true
    userData.username = data.username
    userData.key = data.key
    updateState()
  }
}
checkState()
```
Now we have a working login and logout system. It keeps user data in localStorage which stays on the browser only.
What we have done so far is just the front-end. Our game needs a back-end server to provide the game data. We will stream blocks on the back-end and process game data then serve it through API. Our front-end will broadcast transactions which will update the back-end. In other words, the back-end is only serving the data it receives through the blockchain. We could stream the blocks on the client-side (browser) but it's not efficient and it is just unnecessary bandwidth waste.
***
You can see the running app on https://tic-tac-toe.mahdiyari.info/
The final code is on GitLab https://gitlab.com/mahdiyari/decentralized-game-on-hive

In the next part, we will set up our back-end server and database. Now that I think about it, MySQL might be an overkill for this project. Anyway, let's stick to it for now.

I want to get feedback from the community before continuing further. Help me with your comments and let me know what you think about this project. How can I improve it? Should I explain everything from the basics? I greatly appreciate your feedback.

Thanks for reading.&lt;/div&gt;

There are also other ways to achieve the same result like signing a message with the private key and validating that signature with the public key. ``` const validatePostingKey = async (username, privateKey) =&amp;gt; { const accounts = await hiveTx.call('condenser_api.get_accounts', [[username]]) if ( !accounts || !accounts.result || !Array.isArray(accounts.result) || accounts.result.length &amp;lt; 1 ) { return { result: 0, error: 'Network error or wrong username' } } try { const account = accounts.result[0] const publicWif = account.posting.key_auths[0][0] || '' const generatedPublicKey = hiveTx.PrivateKey.from(privateKey) .createPublic() .toString() if (generatedPublicKey !== publicWif) { return { result: 0, error: 'Wrong key' } } return { result: 1 } } catch (e) { return { result: 0, error: 'Wrong key or network error' } } } ``` updateState() is used to update the HTML interface after user login and logout. ``` const updateState = () =&amp;gt; { const loginButton = document.getElementById('login-button') const logoutMenu = document.getElementById('logout-menu') const usernameButton = document.getElementById('username-button') if (userData.authorized &amp;amp;&amp;amp; userData.username &amp;amp;&amp;amp; userData.key) { loginButton.style.display = 'none' logoutMenu.style.display = 'block' usernameButton.innerHTML = '@' + userData.username } else { loginButton.style.display = 'block' logoutMenu.style.display = 'none' } } ``` And it's time for the logout function. ``` const logout = () =&amp;gt; { userData.authorized = false userData.username = '' userData.key = '' window.localStorage.removeItem('userData') updateState() } ``` We need to check localStorage on the page reload and log in the user if the key is in the localStorage. ``` const checkState = () =&amp;gt; { const localData = window.localStorage.getItem('userData') let data if (!localData) { return } try { data = JSON.parse(localData) } catch (e) { data = userData } if (data.authorized &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.username &amp;amp;&amp;amp; data.key) { userData.authorized = true userData.username = data.username userData.key = data.key updateState() } } checkState() ``` Now we have a working login and logout system. It keeps user data in localStorage which stays on the browser only. What we have done so far is just the front-end. Our game needs a back-end server to provide the game data. We will stream blocks on the back-end and process game data then serve it through API. Our front-end will broadcast transactions which will update the back-end. In other words, the back-end is only serving the data it receives through the blockchain. We could stream the blocks on the client-side (browser) but it's not efficient and it is just unnecessary bandwidth waste. *** You can see the running app on https://tic-tac-toe.mahdiyari.info/ The final code is on GitLab https://gitlab.com/mahdiyari/decentralized-game-on-hive In the next part, we will set up our back-end server and database. Now that I think about it, MySQL might be an overkill for this project. Anyway, let's stick to it for now. I want to get feedback from the community before continuing further. Help me with your comments and let me know what you think about this project. How can I improve it? Should I explain everything from the basics? I greatly appreciate your feedback.

# Hived work (blockchain node software)

## SQL account history plugin for hived

We made some fixes to the SQL account history plugin to enable proper operation with hivemind sync process:
https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/173
https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/commits/bw_live_postgres_dump/
https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/177

 We still have one fix to avoid a potential foreign key violation during live sync (probably will be finished tomorrow).

## HF25 changes (these are described in detail in our [Hive roadmap post](https://hive.blog/hive-139531/@blocktrades/roadmap-for-hive-related-work-by-blocktrades-in-the-next-6-months))

We made some fixes and improvements to the code that handles expiration of governance votes (votes for witnesses and Hive Fund proposals): 
https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/174

We started work on voting window changes for HF25. We expect to finish implementation tomorrow, then we can begin testing.

## Miscellaneous hived changes

We made a fix related to removal of expired Hive Fund proposals: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/176

We finished review of @howo merge requests. Two have been merged to develop and one is still under review:
https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/162
https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/169

We also fixed an intermittent issue with hived shutdown:
https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/157

We added some virtual ops to report various changes in state (mainly accounting-related) that weren’t previously reported: 
https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/167

Some changes to cleanup compile process: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/172
Fix for proper testnet operation: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/175

# Hivemind (2nd layer applications + social media middleware)

Fixed a problem in master branch that caused issues when upgrading an existing hivemind database: 
https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/483

Fixed an issue with git version reporting: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/479

Added a comand-line option to log the time required for hive server to process API requests:
https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/481

Some new tests for bridge API calls:
https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/477

# Postgres extension for fork handling for Modular hivemind

One of the key challenges for modular hivemind (the upcoming 2nd layer application framework) is automated support of fork handling. Automated fork-handling will simplify design of 2nd layer apps so that they don't need to worry about fork-handling logic. 

Currently we’re experimenting with the use of a C-based postgres extension to help accomplish this task (we’re referring to this as the SQL change-audit extension). 

Last week we tested the prototype’s ability to recover the original state of an updated record in the database. Below are links to where this work is going on in the repo:

Several months ago, I introduced Hive Recovery, a service that runs continuously and autonomously to help you recover your account if it were to be compromised.

For more information, I invite you to read the [introduction post](/hive/@arcange/introducing-hive-account-recovery).

Currently, many users have decided to define @hive.recovery as their recovery account and to date, none have yet had to use its services to recover it, which in itself is a good thing.

### One service with several working pieces

The services provided by @hive.recovery consist of two components:

1. The front-end

The front-end is a static HTML page that helps users to configure @hive.recovery as their recovery account. The front-end also helps to request @hive.recovery to initiate the recovery process

2. The back-end

The back-end is a javascript service running on a server that, upon request will verify the identity of an account and initiate the recovery process.

### Front-end improvements

I recently had to provide assistance to users who wanted to change their recovery account. No major issue, but it made me realize that there was still room for improvement, especially on the user interface part.

#### 1. Better error and edge case management

I first improved the error handling and fixed some small bugs regarding their notification.

I also added additional validations, among them the verification of the user's HIVE balance because the change request requires to have at least 0.001 HIVE available.

#### 2. New password and keys generator

I took the opportunity to add a feature intended for the recovery process itself: the possibility of generating a new password and keys.

Indeed, the recovery process requires you to provide your recovery account with the public owner key from a new password and keys set you previously generated for your account.

But to generate this new password and keys set, it was necessary to use an external service, and first to know where to find such a service. This is no longer necessary since this functionality is now directly integrated into the site.

![](https://i.imgur.com/cYYj2De.png)

If you do not have already generated a new password and keys set, you can do it by clicking the &quot;Generate new Password and Keys&quot; button. It will display a new dialog with a new randomly generated password and its related keys.

![](https://i.imgur.com/lFGHHr0.png)

After confirming you have saved your new credentials and clicked on &quot;Continue&quot;, it will automatically copy your new public owner key into the appropriate input field.

Of course, none of the displayed data is stored or transmitted. You can audit the source code that has been updated on [github](https://github.com/VIM-Arcange/hive-Recovery).

The [Hive Recovery User Guide](/hive/@hive.recovery/userguide), which contains all the details about this service has also been updated.

Little things that make your life easier.

## SQL account history plugin

In the last week or so, we continued our work on the SQL account history plugin. 

Don’t be confused by the name of this plugin: while it can and will function as a very fast replacement for the rocksdb account history plugin, its primary purpose is to lay the foundation for “modular hivemind” (an application framework for 2nd layer applications).

We added support for resuming a hived replay configured with the SQL account history plugin. This support is also necessary for enabling the use of this plugin when operated in conjunction with a hivemind running in “live sync” mode. 

The SQL account history plugin also now populates the database with block and transaction signatures needed for get_block api calls.

Finally, we added code to drop/restore the SQL indexes associated with the account history data to enable faster hived replays (this can be useful, for example, if no hivemind sync is happening at the same time).

## Other work on hived

We reviewed recent changes in the hived code, which resulted in some code fixes and code reformats and new unit tests. We also did some preliminary reviews of current merge requests for hived.

# Modular Hivemind (2nd layer application framework)

## Syncing hivemind from SQL account history plugin databases

Hivemind can now run an “initial sync” directly from the postgres data generated by the SQL account history plugin. We repeated the “initial sync” of hivemind that died near the end during our previous test (running for 49.58M blocks) and confirmed that it takes just under 46 hours (just under two days). For comparison, a hivemind sync using the old “pull” process with all our other recent optimizations still took 61.2 hours.

The final database size for this test was: SQL account history-generated data (~1.1 TB) + hivemind sync-generated data (~0.5 TB) for a total size of 1.6 TB. 

## Experimenting with Postgres extensions for fork handling

One of the key challenges for modular hivemind is automated support of fork handling, to remove this burden from 2nd layer applications. Currently we’re experimenting with the use of C-based postgres extensions to help accomplish this task.

## Miscellaneous changes to hive sync

We eliminated use of some SQL constructs in hivemind sync that obtained exclusive locks on tables and therefore prevented database dumps from being run concurrently with a hivemind sync. Without this change, a hivemind server operator would need to temporarily disable his hivemind server in order to make a database backup.

## Official hivemind release v1.24.2

We completed testing of the develop branch, then merged all our latest work on hivemind to the master branch, tagged it as v1.24.2. 

We notified all API node operators that they should upgrade to v1.24.2 as soon as practical, as it contains not only optimizations and the exclusive lock fix, but also various bugfixes related to hivemind indexing and API responses.


# Condenser (https://hive.blog code base)

We finished fixing condenser bugs related to the follows, mutes, and decentralized lists, and deployed a new version of hive.blog with the fixes. At this point, we’ve completed and tested all work on decentralized lists.

# Plans for next week

On hived side, we’ll continue working on changes for HF25 (vote expiration for governance changes, curation vote window changes, merge request review, etc). Depending on how much time we have, we may take a look at the HBD interest code, now that witnesses are experimenting with enabling HBD interest payments. I’ve also considered adding a mechanism for helping to maintain the HBD peg if we have time. I’ll write a post about it if we make enough progress on other fronts in the next week or so that it seems feasible to fit the enhanced pegging mechanism into HF25.

For modular hivemind, we’ll continue to explore ways to automate fork-handling.

On the optimization front, we’re experimenting with python profiling to see if we can further reduce the time for a hivemind initial sync from SQL account history data. For a visualization tool, we’re using kcachegrind.

We also want to look at combining the process of replaying hived with the SQL account history plugin (which takes about 11 hours) while running a hivemind sync simultaneously (which takes 46 hours). Currently these process are running sequentially, which takes 11 + 46 = 57 hours. 

By running them concurrently, I believe we can reduce the overall time to nearly just the time of the hivemind sync (i.e. 46 hours currently). As a reminder, previously this process took 17 hours for a hived replay with rockdsb account history + about 96 hours for a hivemind sync, before we began optimizations of sync time.&lt;/div&gt;

It's been a couple of months since @netuoso [published the initial version of the Hive Ledger App](https://hive.blog/hive-139531/@netuoso/hive-application-for-the-ledger-nano-s-x-hardware-wallet). In order to get official support from Ledger (i.e. the possibility to install it from Ledger Live), we need to meet several requirements. And I'm trying to fulfill them all so we could benefit from the hardware wallet support.

# Code review

First, we need to make sure that the application is stable and secure. I already made a preliminary review of the app and created a Pull Request with some fixes. The next step will be to review the code from a security perspective, following the guidelines provided by Ledger. This requires a bit more work and knowledge than validating transactions serialization etc, but we will get there.

 * https://github.com/netuoso/ledger-app-hive/pull/5/

# Javascript library

To simplify communication with the ledger app, I created a JavaScript/Typescript library. It's really easy to use it with NodeJS. The library covers every functionality supported by the app.

Example usage:

```typescript
import Hive from '@engrave/ledger-app-hive';
import TransportNodeHid from '@ledgerhq/hw-transport-node-hid';
import Transport from '@ledgerhq/hw-transport';

( async () =&amp;gt; {

    console.log('Unlock your ledger....');
    const transport = await TransportNodeHid.create();
    console.log(`Established connection with Ledger Nano S`);

    try {
        const hive = new Hive(transport);
        const {version, arbitraryData} = await hive.getAppConfiguration();
        console.log(&quot;Current version:&quot;, version);
        console.log(&quot;Arbitary data enabled:&quot;, arbitraryData);

        const publicKey = await hive.getPublicKey(`48'/13'/0'/0'/0'`);
        console.log(&quot;Public key:&quot;, publicKey);
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e);
    }
    finally {
        transport.close();
    }

})();
```

## API

 * [getAppConfiguration](#getappconfiguration)
 * [getPublicKey](#getpublickey)
 * [signTransaction](#signtransaction) 

### getAppConfiguration

Get current configuration for HIVE App installed on a Ledger.

```typescript
async getAppConfiguration(): Promise&amp;lt;{version: string, arbitraryData: boolean}&amp;gt;
```

### getPublicKey

Retrieve public key from specified BIP32 path. You can set an additional parameter `confirm: boolean` which will ask the user to confirm the Public Key on his Ledger before returning it. 

```typescript
async getPublicKey(path: string, confirm?: boolean): Promise&amp;lt;{publicKey: string}&amp;gt; {
```

### signTransaction

Sign basic transactions with the specified key path. This method will return signed transactions (a transaction with additional `signatures` property). Please note that extensions are not yet supported for most transactions and operations (except `beneficiaries` for `comment_options`). 

```typescript
async signTransaction(tx: Transaction, path: string): Promise&lt;SignedTransaction&gt;
```

Please be aware that the current implementation of the HIVE Ledger App does not support multisig. This could be also a cool feature and we might add it someday. For now, let's focus on publishing it.

The library is open-source and available on Gitlab and NPM:
 * https://gitlab.com/engrave/ledger/ledger-app-hive

# Ledger Companion App

To prove that the application is working correctly, Ledger requires a sample Companion App. 

I prepared an initial design for a new wallet app and will start developing it soon. The plan is to make it as a wallet targeted at large stakeholders willing to invest in HIVE. It will be focused on governance (voting for witnesses and proposals) and the most significant chain news.

![It will be possible to create a new Hive account directly from app](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/engrave/23wWk6s648pDWBsa1JoJunzjwiXRo9f49h5gbvBg2q65FmshLwjh7mpbHEcrqHRdQmJAg)

![Hive Ledger will display all significant parameters of your account](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/engrave/23vsBhgnPDwTJcjG9YXJp5qfx6828bE9xVTzR6HsZW6XEskYJBs1bZoG99HkjsHBiau1W)

![It will be possible to vote on witnesses and perform other governance actions](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/engrave/23wWnW3EENBacfW6UgsUncKqKVHKiQXRRNftBf1qpAp9GvXMJWu9x7ihqNU1wPktLyhdE)

The library is open-source and available on Gitlab and NPM: * https://gitlab.com/engrave/ledger/ledger-app-hive # Ledger Companion App To prove that the application is working correctly, Ledger requires a sample Companion App. I prepared an initial design for a new wallet app and will start developing it soon. The plan is to make it as a wallet targeted at large stakeholders willing to invest in HIVE.

![hivesigner-development-secure-way-to-sign-in-blockchain](https://images.ecency.com/p/Y2iXpRRkNSnseh3NuL6KUBitJTXrc5K2vbTzBseGEENcE)  

Typescript implementation is clean and helps you to identify type of each parameters. If you are JS developer, you probably love this update because it helps you to write less buggy code. We have also written some tests to make sure each new update into library passes those tests. 

As a part of this update to `hivesigner`, we made minor changes into `hive-uri` package as well, which removes dependencies to old dsteem library.

New version of `hivesigner` package is x4 times smaller in size which means less addition to your website bundle, faster download for entire app in general. Shortly after release, we have made some improvements and better browser support, size x2 times smaller from legacy, still great. **Please note, however due to typescript change, you might have to check how you import library into your apps.**

![hivesigner-package-size](https://images.ecency.com/DQmVHtnik5iTniaH5k2ivQKcFkKZNMQAWVLHrKY5QtNcrhw/image.png)

Try new version `hivesigner@3.2.5` and let us know how it works on your apps. https://www.npmjs.com/package/hivesigner

If you are using `hive-uri` in your apps, consider updating that library as well. https://www.npmjs.com/package/hive-uri

Next in line is to optimise and finalise Hivesigner UI (website) changes and release update to website which will improve user experience.

  &lt;img src=&quot;https://developers.hive.io/images/honey-comb-92.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

My proposal got approved this week, so I've been able to dedicate serious time to documentation.

##### SDK References

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/inertia/se3yfj4k-image.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;See: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.hive.io/apidefinitions/#database_api.list_escrows&quot;&gt;database_api.list_escrows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

We already have what amounts to a master list of API methods on the devportal, called API Definitions.  It's grouped by namespaces and functionality.  You can use this list to figure out what parameters are available for the SDK (software development kit) that you use.

From the standpoint of documentation, I'm referring to an SDK as a module, library, or dependency in your project that connects to the API for you.

Knowing the methods names and operations doesn't always correlate to the same method in your favorite SDK.  So I've added links from the API Definitions that points to a method in the SDK's documentation.

In addition to the methods you can call, the API Definitions also list the operations you can execute on the blockchain:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/inertia/VjfLDBS6-image.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;See: &lt;a href=&quot;http://developers.hive.io/apidefinitions/#broadcast_ops_vote&quot;&gt;vote_operation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

As you can see, even more tools are available for operations like voting, primarily because the additional tools like hive-keychain and hivesigner.js perform these operations in the browser.

##### Python Tutorials

Previously, I did an audit on the Javascript Tutorials.  In the next update, I also have the Python Tutorials fully reviewed.  This process takes a while and I'm about one third of the way through, at the moment.

#### Tintoy

Because we don't have a testnet at the moment, it's important for developers to be able to deploy their own local testnet if they want to try out certain tutorials.

Of course, they can always just point their copy of the tutorial to the mainnet.  But it's nice to have the option of running a local testnet.

I've been maintaining the [testnet setup tutorials](https://developers.hive.io/search/?q=testnet) with that in mind, but if you have docker configured, you can deploy your local testnet using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -P inertia/tintoy:latest
```

As it relates to the devportal, [tintoy](https://hub.docker.com/r/inertia/tintoy) can be an important tool for exploring Hive capabilities, so I've been maintaining the docker image on an ongoing basis by refreshing the image when there are major changes to `hived`.  Big thanks to @someguy123 for providing [hive-docker](https://github.com/Someguy123/hive-docker), which is key to allowing me to maintain the tintoy docker images.

I usually have these sudden ideas out of nowhere about some ***possibly useful*** fun tools and projects. Most of the time it just stays in my *mind palace*.. uhm, but well, sometimes they are lucky &amp;amp; get turned into the ***indefinite unfinished projects***.

Anyways here's something that I've developed which could be useful for some individuals that like to mess &amp;amp; experiment with custom_jsons..

&lt;center&gt;[![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ali-h/VVQn7BFt-image.png)](https://jsondoctor.github.io/)&lt;/center&gt;

**JSON Doctor** is a simple, open source tool that allows you to broadcast custom_json operations on hive blockchain.

Website: https://jsondoctor.github.io/
Source Code: https://github.com/ali-h/jsonDoctor

Custom JSONs are awesome, they can be used to store data on blockchain to build a 2nd layer d-app. 

Since they are mostly used in development cases there isn't a single UI (in my knowledge) that lets you broadcast a ***&quot;custom&quot; json***, so to even learn about it you have to write some code, import some library to work with. So here I have a front-end that can be used to broadcast any valid JSON on the blockchain with active/posting authority.

You can use it with ***Hive Keychain*** or entering your private key (not suggested). It also has some JSON templates to play with which includes hive-engine and blog operations (follow/unfollow). 

This can also act like your gateway to interact with 2nd layers when a certain front-end is down or not accessible. For Example Transferring Hive-Engine tokens.

I got with this really techy kinda theme, don't know how it came to my mind but I like like it! *I like raw themes*.

&lt;center&gt;![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ali-h/Lkq2138n-image.png)&lt;/center&gt;

There are also some options like changing the Auth type &amp;amp; RPC endpoint. It has a Log window that logs every change and transaction status.

I usually use it when I'm testing a script that streams blockchain for specific custom JSONs, it helps avoid writing and running a separate script to broadcast.

I had plans to include a json stream too but got very busy with other ~ ***side projects*** ~ so skipped on further development. maybe sometime later. If you've got something to include please [fork the GitHub repository](https://github.com/jsondoctor/jsondoctor.github.io/network/members) and open a PR. Thanks a lot! Feedback is appreciated.

I usually have these sudden ideas out of nowhere about some ***possibly useful*** fun tools and projects. Most of the time it just stays in my *mind palace*.. uhm, but well, sometimes they are lucky &amp;amp; get turned into the ***indefinite unfinished projects***. Anyways here's something that I've developed which could be useful for some individuals that like to mess &amp;amp; experiment with custom_jsons.. [![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/ali-h/VVQn7BFt-image.png)](https://jsondoctor.github.io/) **JSON Doctor** is a simple, open source tool that allows you to broadcast custom_json operations on hive blockchain. Website: https://jsondoctor.github.io/ Source Code: https://github.com/ali-h/jsonDoctor Custom JSONs are awesome, they can be used to store data on blockchain to build a 2nd layer d-app. Since they are mostly used in development cases there isn't a single UI (in my knowledge) that lets you broadcast a ***&quot;custom&quot; json***, so to even learn about it you have to write some code, import some library to work with. So here I have a front-end that can be used to broadcast any valid JSON on the blockchain with active/posting authority. You can use it with ***Hive Keychain*** or entering your private key (not suggested). It also has some JSON templates to play with which includes hive-engine and blog operations (follow/unfollow). This can also act like your gateway to interact with 2nd layers when a certain front-end is down or not accessible.

Lately our blockchain work has focused on the SQL account history plugin that injects operations, transactions, and block data into a PostgresSQL database (for use by modular hivemind apps such as wallets, games, etc).

We’ve been testing and fixing bugs related to this hived plugin and the associated hivemind sync. As mentioned last time, a replay of hived into hivemind takes 11 hours (as opposed to the 15 hours required by the rocksdb-based plugin, so we already have a decent win on replay time). 

We ran a hivemind sync using this data and it completed in 46 hours (just under 2 days), but unfortunately we had a fail near the end of the sync (probably due to use of a different hived to supply some dynamic API data not yet provided by the plugin), so we still don’t have definitive data on the speed of a full hivemind sync using this method, but I wouldn’t be surprised if we cut the time in half for a full hivemind sync (i.e. from 4 days down to 2 days or even less) by the time we’re done. I say this because we’ve found that the hivemind sync using this method is currently CPU bound (with about 2/3 of CPU being used by the python-based hivemind indexer and 1/3 being used by postgres), so I think we will be able to reduce the 46 hours after we’ve profiled the python code (and maybe the SQL code as well). My best guess right now is that we're CPU bound due to some data transformation prior to writing the data to the database.

# Performance results for SQL account history plugin

We’ve run some performance benchmarks using the new SQL account history plugin (versus the rocksdb account history plugin) with excellent performance gains resulting:

API call:  
`{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot;:&quot;account_history_api.get_ops_in_block&quot;, &quot;params&quot;:{&quot;block_num&quot;:2889020,&quot;only_virtual&quot;:false}, &quot;id&quot;:1}`
ah-rocksdb: ranges from 26s to 64s
ah-sql: 0.9s

API call:
`{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot;:&quot;account_history_api.get_account_history&quot;, &quot;params&quot;:{&quot;account&quot;:&quot;abit&quot;, &quot;start&quot;:125000, &quot;limit&quot;:1000}, &quot;id&quot;:1}`
ah-rocksdb: ranges from 0.3s to 1.2s
ah-sql: 0.03s

API call:
`{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;, &quot;method&quot;:&quot;account_history_api.enum_virtual_ops&quot;, &quot;params&quot;:{&quot;block_range_begin&quot;: 4000000, &quot;block_range_end&quot;: 4020000 }, &quot;id&quot;:1} `
ah-rocksdb: ranges from 36s to 45s
ah-sql: 0.8s

These gains are good enough that we should be able to eliminate the artificial 2000 operation lookback limit currently set on the get_account_history API call when filtering for specific operation types (assuming the node is configured to serve the data from the ah-sql plugin instead of the ah-rocksdb plugin, of course).

# Progress on modular hivemind

Now while the above sync and API response times represent substantial performance gains, that’s not the primary goal of this work. The primary goal is to support the creation of 2nd layer app development using “modular hivemind” deployments, allowing for the creation of unique hive-based apps that can scale to large numbers of users with real-time responsiveness.

The first step in the development of the modular hivemind technology was to validate swapping to a model where we directly inject blockchain data into hivemind’s PostgresSQL database, and as we can see from the benchmark data above, this work is going well. We’ve proved it has better performance and we were also able to switch from “pulling” the data from hived to having hived push the data to us using the existing hivemind indexer code with minor modifications.

The next step is a bit more challenging, design-wise: we plan to add support automatic handling of forks in the hivemind sync process. This will allow for modular hivemind apps to serve up data from the current headblock without any additional delay and cleanly revert whenever a micro-fork occurs (currently 2nd layer apps either have to accept a delay penalty or risk the chance for error if they don’t properly revert the state of their internal data in the case of a micro-fork). Modular hivemind application will gain a built-in micro-fork handler that automatically executes to undo the effects of blocks from the previous fork and replay blocks from the new fork in the case of a fork, eliminating the need for their developers to manually write code for fork handling. We’re currently looking into various algorithms for this fork handling logic and next we’ll be experimenting with some prototype implementations.

# Hivemind-based account history API

We also recently completed a python-based account history API that reuses the SQL queries that we developed for the hived SQL account history plugin (this could be used, for example, to reduce API loading on a hived instance). The performance of this API was roughly comparable to that of the ah-sql plugin, but preliminary performance tests show it a little slower (maybe 30% in some cases), probably due to more overhead during data conversions. Still this could be an acceptable tradeoff in some situations and we haven't done any tests in high load situations, where hivemind may perform better than hived.

# Hivemind API (2nd layer microservice for social media apps)

We fixed bugs and created new tests related to the follow code and decentralized lists and merged them to the develop branch (https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/396). 

We also merged in a few more remaining optimizations to hivemind queries: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/470

And created some more tests for community API calls: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/466

# Condenser and wallet (https://hive.blog)

We made one change to fix a bug related to decentralized lists:  https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/merge_requests/209

We completed a preliminary review of vision (ecency code base) versus condesner (hive.blog code base). In general the vision code looks more up-to-date in terms of web technologies and libraries used, and the code is cleaner overall, but the vision code currently relies on too much closed-source APIs to operate it easily as a white-labeled application yet. So before we begin contributing to this work, we’re awaiting changes from @good-karma team.

# Near-term work plans and work in progress

We’ll continue working on modular hivemind code, with an emphasis in the next cycle on design of micro-fork handling logic. We’ll also continue tests and optimization of SQL account history plugin and hivemind sync process.

We began testing the current head of develop branch of hivemind (this contains follows and decentralized list fixes) on api.hive.blog today. If it performs well, we’ll merge it to master on Monday so that other API node operators can deploy it.

I’ve also given some thought in the last week to ways to improve the upward side of the HBD peg (when HBD goes above $1 USD).  I have one idea that looks relatively simple to implement that could probably be fit into HF25. I’ll write more about it later in a separate post in the Hive Improvements community so that there can be some discussion about the economic considerations involved.&lt;/div&gt;

I have been involved (voluntarily) with the development of the Condenser &amp;amp; Wallet apps (that are powering https://hive.blog and https://wallet.hive.blog) for quite a while now. There are other great frontends to Hive out there such as https://peakd.com and https://ecency.com but I have always been more or less faithful with the Condenser.

This is a regular report on my new contributions. Some of the new work below might still be in test and not yet deployed.

## Delegation revoke bug fix
@ausbitbank raised this wallet issue where clicking on the `revoke` button on the delegation list on the wallet won't do anything. There was a typo in the code which was causing the feature fail to retrieve username of the delegator.
Merge request: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/wallet/-/merge_requests/95

## Redirect some URLS from Condenser to Wallet.
Another @ausbitbank request. The Condenser used to handle the `transfers` and `witnesses` pages, however, for security reasons, the Condenser was split into a second app, the Wallet. This new request was to redirect the URLs from the condenser to the wallet instead of erroring.

Merge request: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/merge_requests/207

## Alternate post author:
@themarkymark requested porting feature implemented on @peakd to the Condenser. Once this feature is deployed, you will be able to create a new post and specify the username of an author if it is different from the account you are using to submit the post.
