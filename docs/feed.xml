Keep reading to discover the new features and check the full list of improvements ;)

&lt;center&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The new release is now live at https://peakd.com&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

![release_cover_2021_04_27.jpg](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/peakd/23tvCw8qNqAn6wxZKhC1YXDEpoiXGbJskMY4VkvqEDcrF5qLk7ErxxWdMkts9dC7Dzvpc.jpg)


#### 1. Introduce Curated Content Collections (CCC)

Curated Content Collections (CCC shorthand) is by far the biggest feature introduced in this release. This is something we have discussed for quite some time in the past months and finally we have found a way to implement and support this feature in a way we hope you will enjoy.

With CCC you can now share a curated list of posts in a nice and simple way. And you can also add a small comment to each link you add to the collection.
If you are used to write posts on [peakd.com](https://peakd.com) it will be easy to create a new collection. Because collections are fully decentralized and backed by a normal post that you can share in your blog or in a community (we created a community in case you don't know where to post it) and showcase in your profile. To create a collection there is an option directly in the top bar or in the post 'advanced' settings.

If you want to have a look we have created a few collections beforehand:
https://peakd.com/ccc/jarvie/amazing-locations-of-utah
https://peakd.com/ccc/jarvie/hive-hardfork-25


![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/peakd/23wMmD3qYqE1F6XdsaDvkuP8jM7LatkqJ964Dxm3bMavQ6E7qprjUnqz6vEuQu8WvbhwA.png)


But collections are just simple posts so you can also view with the standard layout, but with some new embedded content 😉

![CCC when opened as a post](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/asgarth-dev/23tcNhnr57dfCQzTbJ8UXv6XPTzppzH7XRZWqBAM8LrQ1vZcEuwndQHrSSQJyneg6JyLY.png)


Of course those collections can be seen in the user profile on a dedicated page: https://peakd.com/@jarvie/collections


![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/peakd/EoKAEtkkYqsCCNeJKUJY95qeDKwkm21kYukNvMFP5WPSKTjyNkKGMq2iDstqYRuXrbW.png)


And there is a [new badge](https://peakd.com/b/badge-000333) automatically assigned to users (curators) that publish a new collection.

!['Curator' Badge](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/peakd/242NetMSjPwg8hsZqF5MQ6BFLDB6vUqVjHWrKd5UcQnWfr4ZRkY6KGBiyjzLzjEQ4p8w6.png)


#### 2. Hive Engine wallet improvements

The second large update in this release is a complete rework of the Hive Engine wallet section to provide more options and more details.

![HE wallet](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/asgarth-dev/23uFweCqWKH4K4t4gt6Tm34CwMrYArq3oiVdDQUX2vqkFp2eaLdibV5BrhxAdLYtekqBz.png)

New supported operations:
- Stake
- Unstake
- Delegate
- Undelegate
- View your delegations and update them.

Also we integrated a few different API to provide a clear and complete overview of the value of those tokens on HE market, Diesel Pools and (if available) standard price provided by @coingecko.

#### 3. Accumulated HBD interest in Wallet and option to trigger a 'claim'

The Hive wallet now include an estimation of the HBD interests from the last payment. It's possible to trigger a payment with a small HBD transaction to yourself.

#### 4. A Bunch of other improvements worth a mention

A full list of minor updates and fixes is available in the next paragraph, but some of them are worth a small paragraph and explanation.

**Temporary save draft for comments/replies in the browser storage**

When you start writing a comment or reply the text is now temporary saved in your browser cache. This does not work as the drafts for your posts, but should be a convenient way to avoid losing an import or long message by mistake.

**Support 'Truvvl' embeds**

Truvvl is a new app by the @travelfeed team released a few days ago. Embedded content is now supported on [peakd.com](https://peakd.com).

**Support odysee.com (lbry.tv) embeds**

Support for [odysee.com](https://odysee.com) embeds is now available and old [lbry.tv](https://lbry.tv) frames are automatically rewritten. Keep in mind that this only works when embedding the `iframe` directly, and not with a simple link.

#### 5. Some minor improvements and bug fixes

As always some minor improvements, updates and fixes across the website. You can check the full release notes here: **https://peakd.com/about/changelog**.

## Support the @peakd project

Now is probably a nice time to remind you of the ways you can support the development of @peakd.

![Selection_298.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/peakd/w36DQpO7-Selection_298.png)

We have a proposal on the Decentralized Hive Fund. You can review the proposal [here](/proposals/52).
If you agree to the proposal and you think the points mentioned add value to the Hive Blockchain consider supporting it using the above links or directly with **[this link](https://hivesigner.com/sign/update-proposal-votes?proposal_ids=[52]&amp;amp;approve=true)**.

---

We also run a witness server to help produce the blocks for the Hive Blockchain. You can vote for our witness so we are in a position to process more of them.

Vote on the witness page: https://peakd.com/witnesses

- Using Keychain: You just have to click and approve the transaction
- Using HiveSigner: You'll need access to confirm the transaction with your Active Key at least

Hive Keychain for mobile is now available in version 1.1.2 on both Android and iOS (the issue with Apple is finally resolved). It introduces an in-App browser that lets you use your dApps in a similar manner that on desktop, with the dApps issuing requests to Keychain, that will then sign the transactions upon approval.

Here's an example of logging in on PeakD:

https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/keychain/23zRyEJARgwZGS6LoYg85kwBy9n2YV9jc6MVRutVZ2tCGtVVd1Y7cjcCKACoJYTvtEs5W.gif

All the major request types are already implemented, so that you can make the most of your Keychain experience on mobile : 

- Login methods
- Generic broadcasts
- Post / Comment
- Vote
- Transfer (with or without encrypted memo)
- Hive Engine Transfer
- Power up / down
- Delegations
- Proposal votes
- Witness vote / proxy
- Encode / Decode message
- Sign transaction / buffer

The release was delayed by one day to add browser history management and url autocomplete features.
Hope you will enjoy it!

Some additional requests are still missing but more rarely used, and will be added soon.
Additionally, the browser will be improved with favorites and multiple tabs handling. We will also add the possibility to whitelist some requests in the future, in order to mirror the behavior that you can find on the browser extension.

1. The Application is still in Beta. It has been tested extensively but it should not by any means be the only place you store your keys on.
2. To import accounts quickly from your Hive Keychain extension to your mobile App, use the QR Code scanner by pressing the QR code logo:

On your extension, navigate to the menu (top right button), then to `Manage Accounts` and finally click on `Show QR Code`.

It introduces an in-App browser that lets you use your dApps in a similar manner that on desktop, with the dApps issuing requests to Keychain, that will then sign the transactions upon approval. Here's an example of logging in on PeakD: https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/keychain/23zRyEJARgwZGS6LoYg85kwBy9n2YV9jc6MVRutVZ2tCGtVVd1Y7cjcCKACoJYTvtEs5W.gif All the major request types are already implemented, so that you can make the most of your Keychain experience on mobile : - Login methods - Generic broadcasts - Post / Comment - Vote - Transfer (with or without encrypted memo) - Hive Engine Transfer - Power up / down - Delegations - Proposal votes - Witness vote / proxy - Encode / Decode message - Sign transaction / buffer The release was delayed by one day to add browser history management and url autocomplete features. Hope you will enjoy it! Some additional requests are still missing but more rarely used, and will be added soon. Additionally, the browser will be improved with favorites and multiple tabs handling. We will also add the possibility to whitelist some requests in the future, in order to mirror the behavior that you can find on the browser extension. ## Download the Apps [](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hive-keychain/id1552190010) [](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobilekeychain) 1. The Application is still in Beta. It has been tested extensively but it should not by any means be the only place you store your keys on. 2. To import accounts quickly from your Hive Keychain extension to your mobile App, use the QR Code scanner by pressing the QR code logo: On your extension, navigate to the menu (top right button), then to `Manage Accounts` and finally click on `Show QR Code`. ## Discord To communicate with us or become an Alpha tester, join our Discord by following this link : https://discord.gg/3EM6YfRrGv Or scanning this QR Code : ![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/keychain/BRNgvm9y-image.png) #### Core Team @stoodkev : Lead Dev - [Witness](https://hivesigner.com/sign/account-witness-vote?witness=stoodkev&amp;amp;approve=1) @nateaguila : UI/UX @yabapmatt : Founder - [Witness](https://hivesigner.com/sign/account-witness-vote?witness=yabapmatt&amp;amp;approve=1) @aggroed : Founder - [Witness](https://hivesigner.com/sign/account-witness-vote?witness=aggroed&amp;amp;approve=1) --- ### Support Hive Keychain development by voting for [our proposal](https://peakd.com/hive/@keychain/hive-keychain-development-proposal-2) on [PeakD](https://peakd.com/proposals/140) or with [HiveSigner](https://hivesigner.com/sign/update-proposal-votes?proposal_ids=%5B140%5D&amp;amp;approve=true). *100% of payout is redirected to the DAO* See: Hive Keychain Mobile 1.1 : in-App browser by @keychain</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/keychain/xnmVXGi6-social_keychain-for-hive.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/keychain/xnmVXGi6-social_keychain-for-hive.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">9th update of 2021 on BlockTrades work on Hive software</title><link href="https://hivedocs.info/news/core/development/2021/04/26/9th-update-of-2021-on-blocktrades-work-on-hive-software.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="9th update of 2021 on BlockTrades work on Hive software" /><published>2021-04-26T12:27:15-07:00</published><updated>2021-04-26T12:27:15-07:00</updated><id>https://hivedocs.info/news/core/development/2021/04/26/9th-update-of-2021-on-blocktrades-work-on-hive-software</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hivedocs.info/news/core/development/2021/04/26/9th-update-of-2021-on-blocktrades-work-on-hive-software.html">&lt;div id=&quot;content-blocktrades-9th-update-of-2021-on-blocktrades-work-on-hive-software&quot;&gt;Below is a list of Hive-related programming issues worked on by BlockTrades team during the last few weeks:

# Hived work (blockchain node software)
We finished implementing and testing the following hardfork 25 changes:

 [New operation and associated API calls to convert Hive→Hive dollars (HBD) as a means of improving upside pegging of Hive dollars](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/191). For more information, see https://hive.blog/hive-102930/@blocktrades/proposed-hardfork-change-to-stabilize-hive-dollar-s-tracking-of-usd-value

 [Hive dollars must be stored in a savings account to earn interest](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/201). For more information, see: https://hive.blog/hive-102930/@blocktrades/proposal-to-make-hbd-interest-payable-only-to-savings-accounts

[Completed testing and created examples demonstrating functioning of new curation reward rules](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/204)

 New unit tests: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/195

[Fixed small issue that caused vote expiration to happen one block later than it should](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/212)

[Allow votes on posts after they have paid out (votes  once again allowed on posts older than 7 days)](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/189)

We also reviewed @howo support for recurrent transfers in HF25 and expect to merge those changes in tomorrow.

## Other work on hived
[Simplified cmake build options for hived (eliminated various hived build configurations like LOW_MEMORY_NODE and CLEAR_VOTES that weren’t practically useful and mostly just caused confusion)](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/196). 

[Removed support for COMMENT_CONTENT_SUPPORT](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/1930)

 [Improved reporting and debugging capabilities of unit tests](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/206)

 [Allow running a subset of the entire suite based on a filter](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/209)

 [Updated get_config API call with new configuration variables](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/192)


[--force-reply command-line option no longer also requires use of –replay option and it also automatically deletes the shared_memory file, eliminating that manual step](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/190)

[Proposal ids are now reported by proposal-pay virtual operation](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/202)

[Clear the memo key of hive.fund as requested by @smooth](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/210)

[Fix the version of hived reported when SMTs not enabled](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/207)

[Fix a problem with static builds and libreadline](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/issues/143)

[Unify the version of C++ used when building hived and refactor cmake files so that it only requires a change in one place](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/merge_requests/208). 

Currently we’re using C++14 for the hardfork. We tested with C++17 and found one bug, which we fixed, but decided to delay making C++17 the standard version for builds since we’re getting close to hardfork time. After the hardfork, we’ll likely move to C++17 or C++20 for future development.

# Hivemind (2nd layer applications + social media middleware)
[Fixes and improvement to community mute functionality](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/490)

[Fixed pagination of bridge.list_community_roles](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind/-/merge_requests/491)

# Modular hivemind
We’re making solid progress on modular hivemind, especially with regard to fork resolution handling. It looks like we’ll be able to avoid the need for a C extension to postgres and can instead rely on a “SQL-only” solution using “shadow tables” to save and restore changes to the tables that store data that can be changed when hived switches to a different micro-fork.

# Condenser
We made several fixes to condenser and also reviewed some new features by @quochuy and @jpphotography.

# Upcoming work
## Hived code freeze and launch of testnet
We plan to merge in the remaining hived code changes (a few minor fixes + recurrent transfers support) tomorrow, then assist in launch of testnet on Wednesday. 

We’ll test for two weeks, then hopefully be ready to merge the release candidate into the master branch, at which point we’ll give exchanges at least 30 days notice to update. 

So if no problems, we can expect the hardfork in about six weeks from Wednesday.

## Test latest hivemind changes
We’ll be running a full sync of hivemind with the latest changes, then test real world performance in a production environment on api.hive.blog, followed by a production release to the API nodes next week if no problems are found.

## SQL Account history plugin for hived
We plan to complete the changes to the SQL account history plugin that pushes data to postgres (eliminating the need for hivemind to pull the data via RPC calls) in the new couple of days.

After the plugin changes are completed, we’ll run a simultaneous replay of hived with a full sync of hivemind to measure the speedup, and see if it matches our expected improvement in hivemind full sync time (we expect 2 days versus the current 4 days required).&lt;/div&gt;

# meeting tl;dr

# Dev sync

as always listen to this one, @blocktrades touched on many subjects on top of the usual dev sync, we discussed the testnet, updating the libraries and the code freeze among other things.

# Add a testnet test on hf24's restore_accounts function

If you don't know, when starting a testnet, you get a lot of logs like this:

```
714438ms database.cpp:2046             restore_accounts     ] The account aellly hadn't removed balances, balances can't be restored
714438ms database.cpp:2046             restore_accounts     ] The account akiroq hadn't removed balances, balances can't be restored
714438ms database.cpp:2046             restore_accounts     ] The account angelina6688 hadn't removed balances, balances can't be restored
714438ms database.cpp:2046             restore_accounts     ] The account balticbadger hadn't removed balances, balances can't be restored
714438ms database.cpp:2046             restore_accounts     ] The account cheva hadn't removed balances, balances can't be restored
714438ms database.cpp:2046             restore_accounts     ] The account cn-malaysia hadn't removed balances, balances can't be restored
714438ms database.cpp:2046             restore_accounts     ] The account cnfund hadn't removed balances, balances can't be restored
714438ms database.cpp:2046             restore_accounts     ] The account dailychina hadn't removed balances, balances can't be restored
```

Due to hf24 when we restored funds to accounts that won their appeal or were wrongfully not airdropped, but those account don't exist on a testnet to it creates a lot of useless logs. We'll add a condition so that those logs only exist on testnet

# status on community account mutes

You can read up on the issue: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind-/issues/145
It was important to get this done before working on other communities types and I'll be working on it in ~2 month so I wanted to know what was the status on it.

# Force witnesses to run the RC plugin to avoid abuse

Basically make the RC plugin consensus, lots of talk but conclusion was that it wouldn't be for now but would be considered at a later date.

# from @asgarth: Discuss RC delegations

There was quite a bit of back and forth there. In the end we discussed the idea of shipping &quot;rc delegations lite&quot; meaning a version of RC delegations where it's a simple &quot;I delegate rc to you&quot; similar to HP delegations. I need to do some work to figure out if this would cover most of the use cases the rc delegation pools would cover or not and see if it's viable and a better solution scaling and complexity-wise.

We'll add a condition so that those logs only exist on testnet # status on community account mutes You can read up on the issue: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hivemind-/issues/145 It was important to get this done before working on other communities types and I'll be working on it in ~2 month so I wanted to know what was the status on it. # Force witnesses to run the RC plugin to avoid abuse Basically make the RC plugin consensus, lots of talk but conclusion was that it wouldn't be for now but would be considered at a later date. # from @asgarth: Discuss RC delegations There was quite a bit of back and forth there. In the end we discussed the idea of shipping &quot;rc delegations lite&quot; meaning a version of RC delegations where it's a simple &quot;I delegate rc to you&quot; similar to HP delegations. I need to do some work to figure out if this would cover most of the use cases the rc delegation pools would cover or not and see if it's viable and a better solution scaling and complexity-wise. # Support what I'm doing If you like what I'm doing, please consider voting on my new proposal: https://peakd.com/proposals/167 [hivesigner](https://hivesigner.com/import?redirect=%2Fsign%2Fupdate-proposal-votes%3Fproposal_ids%3D%255B167%255D%26approve%3Dtrue&amp;amp;authority=active) See: Hive core developer meeting #22 by @howo</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://hivedocs.info/assets/images/favicon.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://hivedocs.info/assets/images/favicon.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Mutelists, Blacklists: What’s the difference? + FAQ</title><link href="https://hivedocs.info/howto/community/blacklists/2021/04/24/mutelists-blacklists-what-s-the-difference-faq.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mutelists, Blacklists: What’s the difference? + FAQ" /><published>2021-04-24T14:42:30-07:00</published><updated>2021-04-24T14:42:30-07:00</updated><id>https://hivedocs.info/howto/community/blacklists/2021/04/24/mutelists-blacklists-what-s-the-difference-faq</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://hivedocs.info/howto/community/blacklists/2021/04/24/mutelists-blacklists-what-s-the-difference-faq.html">&lt;div id=&quot;content-hivewatchers-mutelists-blacklists-what-s-the-difference-faq&quot;&gt;![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQ48rPArkkRHK9bTYHhYkcrQfWicUS4ZbbEw4RW8GycTx/image.png)

There has been much confusion about the various lists available on Hive.  This post is meant to answer some of your questions to that regard. Please feel free to ask more questions as you see fit. 

# Decentralized blacklists and mutelists
These are on-chain lists based on the 'follow' function, which allows you to interact by either choosing to view in prominence or to hide from view the posts of another account. 

Any user can create a list or subscribe to an existing list that someone else created. When subscribed or created, the list will govern which accounts the user will not see. This is currently widely used for phishing accounts. 

- List is for limiting interaction with accounts on it
- Users and projects are able to create a coherent list of undesirable accounts (in their opinion)
- Subscribers can limit what they themselves can see and keep their experienced focused
- Lists mainly affect the frontend user experience 
- Lists do not have any effect on reward distribution

# Spaminator blacklist
The Spaminator blacklist is for accounts that are involved in **exploitation** on Hive. This is usually directly related to the exploitation of the reward pool. The Spaminator bot works off a ledger of account names, the on-chain interactions of which it logs into its database as it streams the blockchain. 

- A hands-off bot written in Python 
- 76955 accounts on it right now
- 1012 different account groups (grouped for classification purposes) of which many are different botnets
- Very, very few users on it are unique individuals; most are exploitation accounts
- No appeal timer, prompt removal is possible
- No maximum amount of strikes for unique individuals

Only active accounts are logged and are given a warning downvote. Where they are a unique individual, they will come and reply in some way. The unique individuals are usually victims of hacking/phishing or of other scams against them. They are warned through the bot and are helped to recover. 


# Hivewatchers Banlist
What is commonly referred to as the 'Hivewatchers blacklist' is actually a 'banlist'. We are not sure on how this name originally came about as we inherited the project and it's list but that's its official name. 

Hivewatchers is focused on **fraud**. Fraud can be defined as ID theft/deception, plagiarism (of all types), and generally fraudulent activities of various types. 

- Not part of Spaminator
- Used to educate users and give them a chance to be removed
- Only for unique individual accounts 
- Not used for botnets unless the botnet is based on deception
- Has a timer that gets activated for removal after an appeal starts
- A maximum two strikes and no more appeals are possible for unique individuals

# Mutelist vs Spaminator vs Hivewatchers

Because of the words 'list' and 'blacklist' there are many points of confusion around their differences and similarities. 

Stored centrally | Mutelist | Spaminator | Hivewatchers |
-|-|-|-|
Stored centrally in database | No | Yes | Yes |
Created by specific entity | Yes | Yes | Yes |
Limits interaction | Yes | No | No |
Frontend-focused | Yes | No | Yes |
Mandatory for users | No | No | No |
Automatically restores rewards | No | Yes | No |
Downvotes to warn | No | Yes | Yes |
Upvotes to warn | No | No | No |
Scope is set by default | No | Yes | Yes |
Hides post | Yes | No | No |
Is a hands-off bot | No | Yes | Both |
Is a feature | Yes | No | No |
On-chain controls | Yes | No | Yes |

# Outdated Terminology: 'Spam' 
The word 'Spam' is being phased out because of several issues:
- Too overused, vague and unclear
- Commonly used to mislabel and thus downgrade major threats such as phishing that require urgency
- Is often found attributed to everything irrespective of scope by users
- Is used to label low-effort content, shorter content, content that is disliked by the user, content in languages that don't always properly display, etc. 

The most predominant issue is phishing. When phishing becomes mislabeled as spam, the person being warned to either seek help recovering their account or to not click on a malicious link does not understand the severity of the matter. All phishing should always be referred to as 'phishing'. 

The word 'spam' is actively being removed from Hivewatchers comments and we are currently in transition to that regard. 

# Hive.Blog Mutelist
This list is used for phishing/hacked accounts predominantly, with a few accounts spreading malware thrown in. It is a great list to follow by default and is also replicated in the [Plenty of Phish repository](https://github.com/gryter/plentyofphish/blob/master/phishing.txt), on Spaminator and several other places. Once an account is recovered and is safe, it is removed from the list. 

This is one example of a Mutelist being used effectively and for a concrete purpose that warrants subscription and benefits all users irrespective of their beliefs, outlook, or anything else. It is strongly recommended that everyone takes all possible measures to prevent supporting hackers or falling prey to them.

# FAQ

**So why can't Spaminator just use a decentralized list? I still don't understand.**
Spaminator is a bot and needs its data in a local ledger (on its servers) to function. It was made to purely read the chain (it streams the blocks) and constantly querying on-chain lists would put a huge load on the endpoints quite unnecessarily. Additionally, it has about 76k account on it, many of which are massive botnets and not individual users. They are listed in their respective categories and managed through our servers. Adding them to one massive on-chain list is just not practical. 

**Will there be a Hivewatchers decentralized on-chain Mutelist or Blacklist?**
Yes. The Hivewatchers list is quite short in comparison to Spaminator and is meant to focus on fraud, as we already discussed. We'll have an announcement to that regard. We will likely end up with two lists on Hivewatchers; one for accounts that are permanently on and one for those that have a chance to appeal or are appealing. 

**Do you recommend I follow the Hivewatchers list and set my account to automatically downvote everything on it?**
We ask that you keep yourself safe. Some of the accounts we deal with belong to individuals who are extremely dangerous, are known for targeted harassment, death threats, stalking, doxxing, and other similar activities. Use your personal discretion.

**Are all accounts granted appeals?**
No. ID thieves, exploitation ring operators, hackers/phishers, or systemic repeat fraudsters are not granted further consideration. There is a limit to our 'revolving door'. Repeatedly having the same accounts mislead the community in their appeals is damaging to Hive. 

**My account is both on Hivewatchers and Spaminator. Why?**
In cases where there is fraud coupled with exploitation of the blockchain and its reward mechanism, the account may fit both scopes. If the account is part of a botnet or an organized ring, then it will likely be on both.

**Is short-form content allowed on Hive?**
All content is treated the same way: It should be at least 50% original to have some value and anything taken from the internet should be clearly cited. Short-form content doesn't mean that suddenly there is free reign to copy/paste other people's work and make money off it. It is never acceptable to steal from others for personal profit.

**I tried to use the on-chain Mutelist/Blacklist feature and I discovered bugs or issues. What do I do?**
The decentralized list feature is still being developed. Please submit your bugs/issues to https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser

**Should I report hacking/phishing, even if it's not on chain but still related to the Hive ecosystem in general?**
Yes. Please contact @guiltyparties and outline what happened. Even if your dapp got hacked please advise. 

**I hate Hivewatchers and Spaminator and want to disrupt all activities, so I'm upvoting everything Spaminator downvotes.**
If you've decided that scammers should be rewarded, we ask you to still please ensure that you are not supporting those who hack and phish other people's accounts. Just reach out to @guiltyparties on Openhive.chat or Discord and I'll set you up with the appropriate lists to exclude from your 'curation'.  It's not an all or nothing deal. If you are supporting phishing you will be treated the same as the hackers themselves.&lt;/div&gt;

Still, cloudflare send me a  monthly email that shows the amount internet traffic on the site, including some geographical breakdown of that data. So I've long known that the US has consistently been the largest source of our web traffic, ever since the site first launched.

The inspiration of this post was a discussion I was having with @logic. He had found a post that was attempting to do an analysis of hive.blog's traffic based on organic search data (I think, I didn't read too closely) and it made a few incorrect conclusions about traffic on the site, so I decided to publish some of the data we have from cloudflare, after that discussion.

Hive.blog only has the data that cloudflare provides for free, so I can only access the last 30 days worth of traffic data, plus I have those monthly emails which allows me to get a little bit of historical data beyond the past 30 days. So I can only present a few graphs that may be of interest.

# US web traffic for Hive.blog

This graph of US traffic was created by taking US traffic data from the emails (I deleted or moved the email from February apparently, so that's why there's a missing bar in the graph):

![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQtrVBAZmGZUGzBASQafVHsdXs6xh67ELsoWPqoCq2emC/image.png)
I'm not really sure why there was such a huge spike of traffic from the US during the month of May (120M), but there may not have been many other sites able to browse Hive posts during that month, so it may have born the brunt of Hive user traffic during that month. My best guess is that peakd, ecency, etc took away a lot of the traffic in  the next month, once everyone could return to using their preferred post browser.

The graph shows there's been a steady growth of traffic from October of last year until now (2x growth of US traffic over that period), which is nice, especially since we know a lot of other web sites are getting more traction nowadays as post browsers and therefore competing for total Hive traffic. So overall, this looks pretty promising for overall growth of viewership for Hive social media posts.

# Heatmap for hive.blog's worldwide traffic
Here's a heatmap of global traffic to hive.blog, and a numeric breakdown of traffic from the top 5 countries  in the last 30 days by country:

# A few more from the heatmap

I also manually looked up a few other countries on the heatmap (by mousing over them) and roughly sorted the results. Now, this was a fairly tedious process and there's a lot of countries, so please don't be upset if I missed your country.

Still, cloudflare send me a monthly email that shows the amount internet traffic on the site, including some geographical breakdown of that data. So I've long known that the US has consistently been the largest source of our web traffic, ever since the site first launched. The inspiration of this post was a discussion I was having with @logic. He had found a post that was attempting to do an analysis of hive.blog's traffic based on organic search data (I think, I didn't read too closely) and it made a few incorrect conclusions about traffic on the site, so I decided to publish some of the data we have from cloudflare, after that discussion. Hive.blog only has the data that cloudflare provides for free, so I can only access the last 30 days worth of traffic data, plus I have those monthly emails which allows me to get a little bit of historical data beyond the past 30 days. So I can only present a few graphs that may be of interest. # US web traffic for Hive.blog This graph of US traffic was created by taking US traffic data from the emails (I deleted or moved the email from February apparently, so that's why there's a missing bar in the graph): ![image.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmQtrVBAZmGZUGzBASQafVHsdXs6xh67ELsoWPqoCq2emC/image.png) I'm not really sure why there was such a huge spike of traffic from the US during the month of May (120M), but there may not have been many other sites able to browse Hive posts during that month, so it may have born the brunt of Hive user traffic during that month.

This is a version bump and should not adversely affect existing applications that use the `hive-ruby` gem.  Changes are focused on performance improvements to `Hive::Stream` subroutines.

The main change is that we no longer have to rely on `json-rpc-batch` to stream blocks.  Prior to this change, if the API node supported batched requests, it would ask for up to 50 blocks using [this published standard](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch).

But not all API endpoints supported the standard.  In HF24, we got the [`block_api.get_block_range`](https://developers.hive.io/apidefinitions/#block_api.get_block_range) method.  And although not all endpoints support this method, it's much more supported than `json-rpc-batch`.

Hive Ruby will try whatever the endpoint will provide, starting with `get_block_range`, then `json-rpc-batch`, and then just fall back on non-batched requests.

In addition to this new method, if you area streaming virtual operations, Hive Ruby will now use [`account_history_api.enum_virtual_ops`](https://developers.hive.io/apidefinitions/#account_history_api.enum_virtual_ops) (if supported).  This will improve performance and reliability, even when streaming virtual operations from the head block.

I have been involved (voluntarily) with the development of the Condenser &amp;amp; Wallet apps (that are powering https://hive.blog and https://wallet.hive.blog) for quite a while now. There are other great frontends to Hive out there such as https://peakd.com and https://ecency.com but I have always been more or less faithful with the Condenser.

This is a regular report on my new contributions. Some of the new work below might still be in test and not yet deployed.

## Add highlight syntax to code blocks in blog posts
There was [a request for syntax highlighting](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/issues/115) on posts. We indeed have some developers sharing code on the platform. So I tested integrating PrismJS and HighlightJS. I picked HighlightJS due to the way it works nicely with the Condenser.

However, there were some concerns that HighlightJS package is 270KB+ which might be a problem for mobile phone users on a slow bandwidth. So this change might not get approved for deployment to production. See my next contribution below instead.

![Syntax Highlighter](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/uploads/f5417cdefb5d92bdca036ab9c1d83992/Screen_Shot_2021-04-15_at_2.47.54_pm.jpg)

Merge request: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/merge_requests/234

## Supporting GitHub's GIST embeds
@good-karma suggested that instead of highlighting syntax, we could simply add support for [GIST](http://gist.github.com/) embedded views. [GIST is a tool allowing you to share code snippets or data excerpts](http://gist.github.com/). It also has syntax highlighting so integrating it to the Condenser is lightweight.

There is one downside to the method though: old posts not using GIST won't have their code highlighted.

There are other great frontends to Hive out there such as https://peakd.com and https://ecency.com but I have always been more or less faithful with the Condenser. This is a regular report on my new contributions. Some of the new work below might still be in test and not yet deployed. ## Add highlight syntax to code blocks in blog posts There was [a request for syntax highlighting](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/issues/115) on posts. We indeed have some developers sharing code on the platform. So I tested integrating PrismJS and HighlightJS. I picked HighlightJS due to the way it works nicely with the Condenser. However, there were some concerns that HighlightJS package is 270KB+ which might be a problem for mobile phone users on a slow bandwidth. So this change might not get approved for deployment to production. See my next contribution below instead. ![Syntax Highlighter](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/uploads/f5417cdefb5d92bdca036ab9c1d83992/Screen_Shot_2021-04-15_at_2.47.54_pm.jpg) Merge request: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/merge_requests/234 ## Supporting GitHub's GIST embeds @good-karma suggested that instead of highlighting syntax, we could simply add support for [GIST](http://gist.github.com/) embedded views. [GIST is a tool allowing you to share code snippets or data excerpts](http://gist.github.com/). It also has syntax highlighting so integrating it to the Condenser is lightweight. There is one downside to the method though: old posts not using GIST won't have their code highlighted. ![GitHub GIST embeds](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/uploads/45a0e2fb10e2f634c871cfdedd2c5e6e/Screen_Shot_2021-04-17_at_9.19.56_pm.jpg) Merge request: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/merge_requests/238 Thank you @mahdiyari for helping with testing ## Display votes value breakdown Aren't you sometimes curious as to what is the $ contribution of a vote on your post? This little change adds vote value to the voter list of a post. ![Votes value breakdown](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/uploads/b0cb8b7e54df71129624613193e8411e/Screen_Shot_2021-04-22_at_10.34.52_pm.jpg) Merge request: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/merge_requests/242 --- **Vote for my witness** [![Support @quochuy Witness.jpg](https://images.hive.blog/DQmecYTZemY8SwU6rrg7awhpNRBsehUp7ivk9RGyZsUUpVw/quochuy-hive-witness.jpg)](https://hivesigner.com/sign/account-witness-vote?witness=quochuy&amp;amp;approve=1) On Hive, Witnesses are playing the important role of providing a performant and safe network for all of us.

The first version of our in-App browser is ready for testing, on both TestFlight (iOS) and Google Play as version 1.1.0.

This new version adds a browser tab to the Keychain menu, on which users can have the same Keychain experience as on their desktop browser. Testers, please update your App to 1.1.0 to test this new feature. If you wish to try it but are not on our tester list yet, join us on Discord (see below) and drop a message in the join-testers channel.
 
Although it's not complete yet, the most widely used operations are all included and ready to get tested:

- Login methods 
- Generic broadcasts
- Post / Comment
- Vote
- Transfer (with or without encrypted memo)
- Hive Engine Transfer
- Power up / down
- Delegations
- Proposal votes
- Witness vote / proxy
- Encode / Decode message
- Sign transaction / buffer

Please don't hesitate to open issue on [our Github](https://github.com/stoodkev/hive-keychain-mobile/issues).

Future improvements for the in-App browser that are already on the roadmap for the next update include:
- Adding missing requests
- Handle browser history
- Url autocomplete
- Handling multiple browser tabs
- Bookmarking 
- Automatically accept posting authority requests if whitelisted (similar to the browser extension)

1. This is a first release and the Application is still in Beta. It has been tested extensively but it should not by any means be the only place you store your keys on.
2. To import accounts quickly from your Hive Keychain extension to your mobile App, use the QR Code scanner by pressing the QR code logo:

On your extension, navigate to the menu (top right button), then to `Manage Accounts` and finally click on `Show QR Code`.

One of the tools I maintain is Tin Toy.  It's a docker image for running a tiny Hive testnet on your local computer.

With it, you can point your application and test new functionality, without having to broadcast to the mainnet.

I just did a refresh on the `develop` branch so you can try out the next hardfork, HF25.

It's also a tool that comes in handy for me, when I'm doing [documentation](https://peakd.com/c/hive-139531/search?q=devportal), because it helps me find new functionality and create tutorials.  You'll find that anytime the devportal mentions a testnet, it's going to recommend tintoy.  And so for this reason, I feel like this is time well spent when researching and improving the devportal.

To try out the hived 1.26.0, right now:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8090:8090 inertia/tintoy:develop
```

Then point your app API endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

Tin Toy - A tiny Hive testnet based on [tinman](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/tinman)

# Quickstart

```bash
docker run -d -p 8090:8090 inertia/tintoy:latest
```

Using `-p 8090:8090` will expose json-rpc.

... or ...

```bash
docker run -d -P inertia/tintoy:latest
```

Using `-P` will expose all of the ports, ephemerally (see below).

If you want to modify the scripts before deploying:

```bash
git clone https://gist.github.com/b88e7bfff8862858e54c59392e2bce20.git tintoy
cd tintoy
docker build -t myname/tintoy:mybranch .
docker run -d -P myname/tintoy:mybranch
```

For example, you can modify the first line of `Dockerfile` to switch versions of `hived`.

Tin Toy uses:

```Dockerfile
FROM hiveio/hive:latest
```

But you can switch to any branch and try it out.  Suggested branches to try can be found in [hive/activity](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/activity).

Say we want to take a look at a branch like `develop`.  Change the first line of the `Dockerfile` to:

```Dockerfile
FROM hiveio/hive:develop
```

Then build and run.

# Shell In

* Use `docker ps` to get the name of the existing container.
* Use the command `docker exec -it &lt;container name=&quot;&quot;&gt; /bin/bash` to get a bash shell in the container.

# How to Use

Once the docker container has fully deployed, you'll have access to various port.  Internally, the docker container responds to:

| Port | Purpose   |
|------|-----------|
| 2001 | p2p       |
| 8090 | jussi json-rpc |
| 8091 | hived json-rpc |
| 8092 | hivemind json-rpc |
| 5000 | tinman server (if enabled) |

If you launched with `-P` (ephemeral ports enabled), you can get a list of ports:

```bash
docker ps
```

Which might return something like:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                                                                NAMES
290810dba18e        inertia/tintoy:latest   &quot;/bin/sh -c /app/boo…&quot;   5 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes        0.0.0.0:32832-&amp;gt;2001/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32831-&amp;gt;8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32830-&amp;gt;8090/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32829-&amp;gt;8091/tcp   tintoy
```

## Default Secret Key

Normally, the secret key for a testnet is kept secret.  But for a local testnet, there's no reason to keep it a secret.  For tintoy, the default secret key is set in the `Dockerfile`:

```bash
ENV SHARED_SECRET tintoy
```

Which means, if you want to derive the private keys for `tnman`, you could use the following command:

```bash
get_dev_key tintoy owner-tnman active-tnman posting-tnman memo-tnman | jq
```

```json

  }
]
```

Every account on the testnet uses `tnman` as their account authority.  Using this account, you can sign any transaction for any account.

## Snapshot Refresh

Occasionally, it's a good idea to refresh the `sample-snapshot.json` file.  This process is usually only required to be performed by the repo maintainer, but if you want to do it yourself, here are the steps:

1. Install `tinman` by following that product's [README.md](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/tinman#installation).
2. Next, [generate a new snapshot](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/tinman#taking-a-snapshot).
  * Example: `tinman snapshot -s https://anyx.io -o - | pv &amp;gt; snapshot.json`
3. Once we have our new snapshot, create a sample, overwriting the previous one.
  * Example: `tinman sample -i snapshot.json -o sample-snapshot.json`
4. Delete (or move) `snapshot.json` (we don't need it anymore now that we have `sample-snapshot.json`).
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;

&lt;/container&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name>inertia</name></author><category term="tools" /><category term="docker" /><category term="testnet" /><summary type="html">One of the tools I maintain is Tin Toy. It's a docker image for running a tiny Hive testnet on your local computer. With it, you can point your application and test new functionality, without having to broadcast to the mainnet. I just did a refresh on the `develop` branch so you can try out the next hardfork, HF25. It's also a tool that comes in handy for me, when I'm doing [documentation](https://peakd.com/c/hive-139531/search?q=devportal), because it helps me find new functionality and create tutorials. You'll find that anytime the devportal mentions a testnet, it's going to recommend tintoy. And so for this reason, I feel like this is time well spent when researching and improving the devportal. To try out the hived 1.26.0, right now: ```bash docker run -d -p 8090:8090 inertia/tintoy:develop ``` Then point your app API endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` --- Tin Toy - A tiny Hive testnet based on [tinman](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/tinman) # Quickstart ```bash docker run -d -p 8090:8090 inertia/tintoy:latest ``` Using `-p 8090:8090` will expose json-rpc. ... or ... ```bash docker run -d -P inertia/tintoy:latest ``` Using `-P` will expose all of the ports, ephemerally (see below). If you want to modify the scripts before deploying: ```bash git clone https://gist.github.com/b88e7bfff8862858e54c59392e2bce20.git tintoy cd tintoy docker build -t myname/tintoy:mybranch . docker run -d -P myname/tintoy:mybranch ``` For example, you can modify the first line of `Dockerfile` to switch versions of `hived`. Tin Toy uses: ```Dockerfile FROM hiveio/hive:latest ``` But you can switch to any branch and try it out. Suggested branches to try can be found in [hive/activity](https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/activity). Say we want to take a look at a branch like `develop`. Change the first line of the `Dockerfile` to: ```Dockerfile FROM hiveio/hive:develop ``` Then build and run. # Shell In * Use `docker ps` to get the name of the existing container. * Use the command `docker exec -it /bin/bash` to get a bash shell in the container. # How to Use Once the docker container has fully deployed, you'll have access to various port. Internally, the docker container responds to: | Port | Purpose | |------|-----------| | 2001 | p2p | | 8090 | jussi json-rpc | | 8091 | hived json-rpc | | 8092 | hivemind json-rpc | | 5000 | tinman server (if enabled) | If you launched with `-P` (ephemeral ports enabled), you can get a list of ports: ```bash docker ps ``` Which might return something like: ``` CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 290810dba18e inertia/tintoy:latest &quot;/bin/sh -c /app/boo…&quot; 5 minutes ago Up 5 minutes 0.0.0.0:32832-&amp;gt;2001/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32831-&amp;gt;8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32830-&amp;gt;8090/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32829-&amp;gt;8091/tcp tintoy ``` ## Default Secret Key Normally, the secret key for a testnet is kept secret. But for a local testnet, there's no reason to keep it a secret. For tintoy, the default secret key is set in the `Dockerfile`: ```bash ENV SHARED_SECRET tintoy ``` Which means, if you want to derive the private keys for `tnman`, you could use the following command: ```bash get_dev_key tintoy owner-tnman active-tnman posting-tnman memo-tnman | jq ``` ```json [ { &quot;private_key&quot;: &quot;5K5kjWq8pY23YptZaiEkiiaKi1wafufj63nzAtaDu1epVXw9fvz&quot;, &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;TST7uubH7SpknapasQTzW1rFho3LUn1pFmdR7X4f1cHmK22aTJYm3&quot;, &quot;account_name&quot;: &quot;owner-tnman&quot; }, { &quot;private_key&quot;: &quot;5K3NwkFwCnsSfJNACw1qm3zzojWBtP8k4rTb2kbLQ4DDR6TgGnw&quot;, &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;TST4w9GXogQtqPprzPhp7WKZPPKWXv4KvqqMMgd5agJQCDtYLBJwA&quot;, &quot;account_name&quot;: &quot;active-tnman&quot; }, { &quot;private_key&quot;: &quot;5Jrdrbt5xfjVeHfHd5JMiJy1FfrGtuieRvzr9WFYhcdHpjgfwPY&quot;, &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;TST883nSqJL5KbVgfdV44snPPDTStQQxfR7vj8XttsZo25sXvHAnQ&quot;, &quot;account_name&quot;: &quot;posting-tnman&quot; }, { &quot;private_key&quot;: &quot;5KB3ddeh5o3WghSM3qQaUthxVt7QZWfNYCoiAW3XYfeDki1oH9z&quot;, &quot;public_key&quot;: &quot;TST56jtUgZrajuBUgdECYaew6cebjSbKWVdtCKkc4xxLAFZQ9f8A9&quot;, &quot;account_name&quot;: &quot;memo-tnman&quot; } ] ``` Every account on the testnet uses `tnman` as their account authority.
