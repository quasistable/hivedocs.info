All accounts on the HIVE blockchain that existed also before the fork may have posting permissions granted to apps that do not exists on the HIVE blockchain. It is a good idea to remove them for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use beempy to remove posting permissions to your account. At first,
all account that have posting/active permissions should be printed with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;beempy permissions holger80
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;remove-posting-permission&quot;&gt;Remove posting permission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, not needed permissions can be removed by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;beempy disallow -a holger80 busy.app
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where the account name is set with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt;.
This command broadcasts a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;account_update&lt;/code&gt; operation and removes the given account name from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;account_auths&lt;/code&gt; field.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/holger80/nNzpFYoS-image.png&quot; alt=&quot;image.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can also be done with https://hivesigner.com/revoke/ followed by the account name, e.g. https://hivesigner.com/revoke/busy.app&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;recovery-account&quot;&gt;Recovery account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recovery account can be check with https://hiveblocks.com/@holger80
&lt;img src=&quot;https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/holger80/n5L0jCIN-image.png&quot; alt=&quot;image.png&quot; /&gt;
It is set to @steem for my account and as it is most unlikely that @steem will ever sign a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Request_account_recovery&lt;/code&gt; operation on HIVE, I’m unable to recovery my account, when I would accidentally leak my owner key and someone would change it using my leaked owner key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is most unlikely, as I’m not using my owner key but it could happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-does-account-recovery-work&quot;&gt;How does account recovery work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming, my owner key was changed within 30 days, I have the previous owner key and the recover account is signing, I can recover my account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I need to create a new owner key&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the recover account broadcasts a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Request_account_recovery&lt;/code&gt; operation with the new owner public key  signed with its active key&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I need then to broadcast a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Recover_account&lt;/code&gt; operation with the old and the new owner public key and sign it with the old and the new owner private key.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I can change now all keys with an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Account_update&lt;/code&gt; operation signed with the new owner key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently this will not work for me, as @steem will not broadcast a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Request_account_recovery&lt;/code&gt; operation on HIVE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;changing-the-recover-account&quot;&gt;Changing the recover account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a new account @recovery.account on HIVE as my new recovery account.
It would be possible to use hivesigner for this:
https://hivesigner.com/sign/change_recovery_account?account_to_recover=holger80&amp;amp;new_recovery_account=recovery.account&amp;amp;extensions=%5B%5D
But I do like to use my own script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;from beem.account import Account
from beem.nodelist import NodeList
from beem import Steem
from beem.transactionbuilder import TransactionBuilder
from beemgraphenebase.account import PrivateKey
import beembase
import getpass


if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:
    nodes = NodeList()
    nodes.update_nodes()
    key = getpass.getpass(prompt='Owner key: ')
    owner_key = PrivateKey(wif=key)
    print(&quot;pub: %s&quot; % str(owner_key.pubkey))
    account_name = input(&quot;account name: &quot;)
    new_recovery_account = input(&quot;new recovery_account: &quot;)
    hive = Steem(node=nodes.get_nodes(hive=True))
    assert hive.is_hive
    
    account = Account(account_name, steem_instance=hive)
    new_rec_acc = Account(new_recovery_account, steem_instance=hive)
    
    op = beembase.operations.Change_recovery_account(**{
        'account_to_recover': account['name'],
        'new_recovery_account': new_rec_acc['name'],
        'extensions': []
    })
    print(op)
    prompt = input(&quot;Broadcast the operation? [y/n]&quot;)
    if prompt[0] == &quot;y&quot;:
        tb = TransactionBuilder(steem_instance=hive)
        tb.appendOps([op])
        tb.appendWif(str(owner_key))
        #tb.appendSigner(account['name'], 'owner')
        tb.sign()
        trx = tb.broadcast()
        print(trx)
    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/holger80/N8fWV7bM-image.png&quot; alt=&quot;image.png&quot; /&gt;
This means that in 30 days my recovery account will be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will keep the keys of @recovery.account in a safe place and will not use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-there-a-need-for-a-recovery-account-provider&quot;&gt;Is there a need for a recovery account provider?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want also to change your recovery account? How could this work? Let me know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello there, as you may or may not know the server requirements for hosting a witness server is growing very fast. To combat this, with the recent hardforks to the blockchain MIRA was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIRA caches the data on RocksDB files rather than the random acces memory, RAM. Which means you will require a higher storage with fast R/W speeds like SSDs for example. Instead of 64 GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, as of today (&lt;strong&gt;02.04.2020&lt;/strong&gt;) the &lt;strong&gt;absolute minimum&lt;/strong&gt; requirements for a MIRA node is 8 Gigabytes of RAM, 400GB SSD Storage, 4 cores, 100 Mbps DL/UL speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;recommended&lt;/strong&gt; specifications for a MIRA witness/seed node is 32 Gigabytes of RAM, 500GB SSD Storage, 4 cores, 1 Gbps DL/UL speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Block logs currently take about &lt;strong&gt;258 GB&lt;/strong&gt; of space while RocksDB takes about &lt;strong&gt;37 GB&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/5KTmBrV.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Witnesses are of course, crucial to the longevity, stability and decentralization of the chain. If you wan to create a witness server and become a witness, good for you and thank you for volunteering! Managing servers and keeping tabs on them is no easy feat. Lets not forget to mention, cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-setting-up-your-witness-on-a-fresh-install-diy&quot;&gt;Start Setting Up Your Witness On A Fresh Install [DIY]&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have decided on setting up a witness server using MIRA. You have your server ready, freshly installed. Preferably Ubuntu or Debian, but that’s just my taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the setup, we will be using steem-docker made by someguy123 and RocksDB files provided by &lt;a href=&quot;privex.io&quot;&gt;Privex.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started. Throughout this tutorial, I will be assuming you are &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have to install git so we can use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; to get the necessary files from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;apt install git -y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we clone the repository from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git clone https://github.com/someguy123/steem-docker.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; has downloaded the repository to your server, we have to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into the folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd steem-docker&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we are going to use the custom-made script to install &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./run.sh install_docker&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will probably take a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we will be installing the necessary docker package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./run.sh install someguy123/hive:latest-mira&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we will be setting up the .env for docker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nano .env&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;DOCKER_NAME=witness
PORTS=
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paste these in the .env file and save it by pressing CTRL+X and then Y.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next step is to download the block_log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir root/data/witness_node_data_dir/blockchain
cd root/data/witness_node_data_dir/blockchain
curl -fsSL http://files.privex.io/hive/block_log.lz4 -o - | lz4 -d - block_log
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the block_log is quite big, this is going to take anywhere from 20 minutes to several hours depending on the internet connection of your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the block_log has been installed, we have to download the RocksDB files from Privex.io&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For HIVE,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rsync -av --progress --delete rsync://files.privex.io/hive/rocksdb/ /root/steem-docker/data/rocksdb/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that our RocksDB is downloaded, we must generate a brain key for security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd root/steem-docker
./run.sh remote_wallet
suggest_brain_key
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/oP0tCAy.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will generate a key pair for your witness. Copy the output and save it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After generating your witness keys we must edit &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;config.ini&lt;/code&gt; which is the main configuration for the witness server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nano root/steem-docker/data/witness_node_data_dir/config.ini&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first line, you will see &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;p2p-endpoint&lt;/code&gt; we should comment this out as our goal is to make a witness server, if you are looking to host a seed node rather than a witness server, you can keep this on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can comment this out by putting a pound (#) in front of the line. So it should look like this,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#p2p-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:2001&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, a few lines below that you will see,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shared-file-size = 64G&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please change this to your server memory, if your server has 16 gigabytes of RAM, change this to 16G and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, scroll down until you see &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;witness&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;private-key&lt;/code&gt; lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the witness part, put in your username with “” it should look like this,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;witness = &quot;deathwing&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, for the private key put in your previously saved private key without any quotation marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;private-key = 5thisisyourpreviosulygeneratedprivatekey&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/z8DDsT1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, press CTRL+X and then Y to save the file and exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are almost done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next step is to replay the chain, this is going to take quite a long time as this process is single-threaded and can’t take advantage of multi-core CPUs, so depending on your processors’ single-thread performance, the amount of time it takes will vary. Very likely for it to take an hour if not more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./run.sh replay&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the replay is complete, we can start our server and let it sync with the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./run.sh start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can then use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./run.sh logs&lt;/code&gt; to view the log output. It is very normal to see errors appearing here from time to time. You should check it every 20-30 minutes until you see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/sCSVd8y.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you start seeing these messages, you can press CTRL+C to leave the logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that our witness server is synced up and ready to go, we can update our witness account and broadcast it to the network. To do that, we need to run wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./run.sh wallet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wallet will prompt you to set a password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set_password hunter2 (set your own password)
unlock hunter2
import_key 5yourwitnessaccountsactiveprivatekey
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find your private key on PeakD - https://peakd.com/@yourusername/permissions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/lCrGKoc.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;import_key&lt;/code&gt; you need to put in the private key of the account that will be witnessing on the chain &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the one previously generated in this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we can update our witness and start our journey on supporting the stability, longevity and decentralization of the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;update_witness &quot;WITNESSNAME&quot; &quot;WITNESSURL&quot; &quot;STMxxxxxxx&quot; {&quot;account_creation_fee&quot;:&quot;3.000 HIVE&quot;,&quot;maximum_block_size&quot;:65536,&quot;sbd_interest_rate&quot;:0} true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WITNESSNAME&lt;/code&gt; = Your Witness account.
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;WITNESSURL&lt;/code&gt; = Preferably, your witness announcement post.
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;STMxxxxxxx&lt;/code&gt;= Paste the key that we previously generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check &lt;strong&gt;hiveblocks.com/@yourusername&lt;/strong&gt; now, if everything worked you should see a transaction like this;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1JoL29X.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You are now a witness. Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-want-to-become-a-witness-but-i-dont-know-a-thing-about-servers&quot;&gt;I want to become a witness but I don’t know a thing about servers!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best way to become a witness in a situation like this is probably purchasing a pre-replayed witness node from &lt;a href=&quot;privex.io&quot;&gt;privex.io&lt;/a&gt; who provided both the scripts and files used in this tutorial. This option is the best for users who do not have a good server knowledge and want excellent customer support and during their journey on becoming a witness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you order your VPS-HIVE server from, you should receive a mail containing the information you need to connect and login to the server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you log in, what you have to do is first, switch from the user &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ubuntu&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;, to do this type,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;su&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we will be generating a key pair using&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;./run.sh remote_wallet
suggest_brain_key
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then, edit the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;config.ini&lt;/code&gt; file with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nano data/witness_node_data_dir/config.ini&lt;/code&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/6eJ7jfU.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then start the witness server with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./run.sh start&lt;/code&gt; wait for it to sync,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then run wallet with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./run.sh wallet&lt;/code&gt; and update your witness as shown previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you have any questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>site curated by: @inertia</name></author><summary type="html">Hello there, as you may or may not know the server requirements for hosting a witness server is growing very fast. To combat this, with the recent hardforks to the blockchain MIRA was introduced. MIRA caches the data on RocksDB files rather than the random acces memory, RAM. Which means you will require a higher storage with fast R/W speeds like SSDs for example. Instead of 64 GB of RAM. Right now, as of today (02.04.2020) the absolute minimum requirements for a MIRA node is 8 Gigabytes of RAM, 400GB SSD Storage, 4 cores, 100 Mbps DL/UL speed. The recommended specifications for a MIRA witness/seed node is 32 Gigabytes of RAM, 500GB SSD Storage, 4 cores, 1 Gbps DL/UL speed. Block logs currently take about 258 GB of space while RocksDB takes about 37 GB. Witnesses are of course, crucial to the longevity, stability and decentralization of the chain. If you wan to create a witness server and become a witness, good for you and thank you for volunteering! Managing servers and keeping tabs on them is no easy feat. Lets not forget to mention, cheap. Start Setting Up Your Witness On A Fresh Install [DIY] So you have decided on setting up a witness server using MIRA. You have your server ready, freshly installed. Preferably Ubuntu or Debian, but that’s just my taste. For the setup, we will be using steem-docker made by someguy123 and RocksDB files provided by Privex.io Let’s get started. Throughout this tutorial, I will be assuming you are root. First, we have to install git so we can use git clone to get the necessary files from GitHub. apt install git -y Now, we clone the repository from GitHub. git clone https://github.com/someguy123/steem-docker.git Now that git has downloaded the repository to your server, we have to cd into the folder. cd steem-docker Next, we are going to use the custom-made script to install docker for us. ./run.sh install_docker This will probably take a minute. Next, we will be installing the necessary docker package. ./run.sh install someguy123/hive:latest-mira Next, we will be setting up the .env for docker. nano .env DOCKER_NAME=witness PORTS= Paste these in the .env file and save it by pressing CTRL+X and then Y. Next step is to download the block_log. mkdir root/data/witness_node_data_dir/blockchain cd root/data/witness_node_data_dir/blockchain curl -fsSL http://files.privex.io/hive/block_log.lz4 -o - | lz4 -d - block_log As the block_log is quite big, this is going to take anywhere from 20 minutes to several hours depending on the internet connection of your server. After the block_log has been installed, we have to download the RocksDB files from Privex.io For HIVE, rsync -av --progress --delete rsync://files.privex.io/hive/rocksdb/ /root/steem-docker/data/rocksdb/ Now that our RocksDB is downloaded, we must generate a brain key for security. cd root/steem-docker ./run.sh remote_wallet suggest_brain_key This will generate a key pair for your witness. Copy the output and save it. After generating your witness keys we must edit config.ini which is the main configuration for the witness server. nano root/steem-docker/data/witness_node_data_dir/config.ini On the first line, you will see p2p-endpoint we should comment this out as our goal is to make a witness server, if you are looking to host a seed node rather than a witness server, you can keep this on. You can comment this out by putting a pound (#) in front of the line. So it should look like this, #p2p-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:2001 Next, a few lines below that you will see, shared-file-size = 64G Please change this to your server memory, if your server has 16 gigabytes of RAM, change this to 16G and so on. Next, scroll down until you see witness and private-key lines. For the witness part, put in your username with “” it should look like this, witness = &quot;deathwing&quot; Next, for the private key put in your previously saved private key without any quotation marks. private-key = 5thisisyourpreviosulygeneratedprivatekey Again, press CTRL+X and then Y to save the file and exit. You are almost done! Our next step is to replay the chain, this is going to take quite a long time as this process is single-threaded and can’t take advantage of multi-core CPUs, so depending on your processors’ single-thread performance, the amount of time it takes will vary. Very likely for it to take an hour if not more. ./run.sh replay After the replay is complete, we can start our server and let it sync with the network. ./run.sh start You can then use ./run.sh logs to view the log output. It is very normal to see errors appearing here from time to time. You should check it every 20-30 minutes until you see something like this: When you start seeing these messages, you can press CTRL+C to leave the logs. Now that our witness server is synced up and ready to go, we can update our witness account and broadcast it to the network. To do that, we need to run wallet. ./run.sh wallet The wallet will prompt you to set a password. set_password hunter2 (set your own password) unlock hunter2 import_key 5yourwitnessaccountsactiveprivatekey You can find your private key on PeakD - https://peakd.com/@yourusername/permissions Remember that for import_key you need to put in the private key of the account that will be witnessing on the chain not the one previously generated in this tutorial. Now, we can update our witness and start our journey on supporting the stability, longevity and decentralization of the blockchain. update_witness &quot;WITNESSNAME&quot; &quot;WITNESSURL&quot; &quot;STMxxxxxxx&quot; {&quot;account_creation_fee&quot;:&quot;3.000 HIVE&quot;,&quot;maximum_block_size&quot;:65536,&quot;sbd_interest_rate&quot;:0} true WITNESSNAME = Your Witness account. WITNESSURL = Preferably, your witness announcement post. STMxxxxxxx= Paste the key that we previously generated. You can check hiveblocks.com/@yourusername now, if everything worked you should see a transaction like this; Congratulations! You are now a witness. Thank you!

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-trade-some-hbd-for-hive&quot;&gt;Let’s trade some HBD for HIVE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we should check our balance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;beempy balance holger80
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then start to sell 1 HBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;beempy sell -a holger80 1 HBD
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m now asked if the price is ok:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Is the following Price ok: 0.253913 HBD/HIVE [y/n]:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and should then enter my active wif:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Password to unlock wallet or posting/active wif:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see then the broadcasted op:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of selling 1 HBD, I can also buy 1 HIVE by&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;beempy buy -a holger80 1 HIVE

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can now sell 1 HBD @ 0.253993 HBD/HIVE as shown in the Asks column and the order should be fulfilled without waiting. Let’s try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; beempy sell -a holger80 1 HBD 0.253993
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I can enter the wif without asking for the price. The orderbook is empty this time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;beempy openorders  holger80

&lt;p&gt;I hope this help as long as the internal market has no interface.&lt;/p&gt;

What a day we’ve had!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to the new Hive blockchain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve been up and running for more than 24 hours now, so this is a good time to take a quick look at the launch and what’s coming up for the immediate future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/hiveio/E9GxfkAx-hivehasarrived.gif&quot; alt=&quot;#hivehasarrived ... a cool asset provided by community member @derangedvisions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-hive-blockchain-launch-went-incredibly-smoothly-given-the-pressure-and-effort-involved-in-getting-a-hardfork-ready-in-such-a-tight-window&quot;&gt;The Hive blockchain launch went incredibly smoothly given the pressure and effort involved in getting a hardfork ready in such a tight window.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The passionate team of developers who went above and beyond to produce the changes needed for Hive did an amazing job (and got very, very little sleep.) Hardforks always have a chance of finding “an edge case” when they go live, so being prepared for anything is necessary. Hive came alive, slowly worked through the operations that needed to done, produced first blocks and transactions, and has been moving steadily ever since. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;No stalls or crashes, fast blocktimes, all good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It has been a huge win for the whole community to start us off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;this-is-a-short-post-with-a-few-important-points-of-information-in-the-coming-weeks-there-are-a-number-of-important-things-that-need-to-be-addressed-that-well-be-posting-about-here&quot;&gt;This is a short post with a few important points of information. In the coming weeks, there are a number of important things that need to be addressed that we’ll be posting about here:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There will be a future hardfork to upgrade Hive, make some fixes, and bring more features online&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ll make a post about those who were skipped in the first airdrop discussing the script for the exclusions and letting the community decide if the tokens held in reserve should be distributed. We will also talk about the Hive DHF (Decentralised Hive Funding), or HiveDAO, and how it can be used in this situation and others to help collect community feedback&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The hive code repo is open source and public at: https://github.com/openhive-network/hive/releases . The condenser repo (for front ends) is being worked on actively to finish up the https://hive.blog/ MVP to a higher standard than previous iterations, and then will also be public. This code is open source as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Hive ecosystem is coming alive! It’s still very early, but many apps and projects are coming online, and we’ll be making sure to help spread the word about useful services in the ecosystem to help your transition to Hive. https://hiveprojects.io/ is a good place to submit your OWN project, but also to learn about what’s going on around the Hive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remember-that-the-goal-of-hive-is-to-move-towards-true-decentralized-community-development-and-that-anyone-can-contribute-whatever-they-like-this-is-your-place-to-live-play-and-work-so-make-it-what-you-want-to-see&quot;&gt;Remember that the goal of Hive is to move towards &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; decentralized community development, and that anyone can contribute whatever they like! This is your place to live, play and work, so make it what you want to see.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-few-final-important-notes&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few final important notes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hive.blog wallets are being actively worked on and will be ready 🔜™️, so if you are wanting secure ways to make wallet transactions, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://peakd.com/&quot;&gt;PeakD.com&lt;/a&gt; wallet, as well as the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/netuoso/vessel/releases&quot;&gt;Hive Vessel&lt;/a&gt; are available. There are a number of familiar wallets and sites being ported right now, so if you’re okay with waiting, you will have a number of options. If you started a powerdown on Steem, it will still be in place on Hive! Don’t forget to stop it if you need to.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you already have an account on Steem, then you have an account waiting for you here on Hive!&lt;/strong&gt; You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://peakd.com/communityfork/@hiveio/announcing-the-launch-of-hive-blockchain&quot;&gt;read more in depth at our info post&lt;/a&gt; if you need a refresher. If you’re new, or want to onboard someone new, then you can check a few signup options at https://signup.hive.io/. There will be more available in the future- this is only to start!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key safety still matters!&lt;/strong&gt; Please consider using Hive Keychain (still under review by the app stores, but here’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://peakd.com/hive/@themarkymark/how-to-install-hive-keychain&quot;&gt;great tutorial&lt;/a&gt;) or &lt;a href=&quot;https://peakd.com/hive/@good-karma/hivesigner-released-and-ready&quot;&gt;HiveSigner&lt;/a&gt; (the new Hive version of Steemconnect). Both will be supported by hive.blog and &lt;a href=&quot;https://peakd.com/&quot;&gt;PeakD.com&lt;/a&gt; has already integrated them, alongside their own PeakLock. Most apps and frontends have already begun work or &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; work with a key management solution like one of these.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember that your witness votes from Steem will carry over to Hive.&lt;/strong&gt; Whichever blockchain you use, votes are available. You are part of governance, so this is an excellent time to start fresh and discover all of the dedicated witnesses in both ecosystems. Many people worked hard to bring Hive to life, and some are witnesses. Please review your votes on Hive as often as you feel like, and vote according to what you want to see and to those you want to support. There are a huge amount of witnesses, from consensus (top twenty) to backup, and they should &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; be part of your considerations if you believe they are the right fit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exchanges are working on getting up and running.&lt;/strong&gt; Right now, Ionomy has full, limited time fee free trading enabled. The other exchanges listing Hive are already working on getting their trading pairs online. There are 6 more exchanges who are working on the airdrops, with some of them also working on a listing. However, these things do need to be done safely, and take a lot of behind the scenes tech support, so please note that &lt;strong&gt;this process can take a little while.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-hive-is-buzzing-and-thats-thanks-to-people-like-you-the-spirit-and-energy-around-the-chain-are-invigorating-make-this-a-time-to-start-fresh-and-spread-your-wings&quot;&gt;The Hive is buzzing, and that’s thanks to people like YOU. The spirit and energy around the chain are invigorating…. make this a time to start fresh and spread your wings.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; our fumble fingered worker bee needed to refresh the post while making it and was so excited they forgot to decline the rewards. These will be powered up so this account no longer needs delegation, and will continue to decline rewards in the future. Sorry!&lt;/p&gt;

There are a number of familiar wallets and sites being ported right now, so if you’re okay with waiting, you will have a number of options. If you started a powerdown on Steem, it will still be in place on Hive! Don’t forget to stop it if you need to. If you already have an account on Steem, then you have an account waiting for you here on Hive! You can read more in depth at our info post if you need a refresher. If you’re new, or want to onboard someone new, then you can check a few signup options at https://signup.hive.io/. There will be more available in the future- this is only to start! Key safety still matters! Please consider using Hive Keychain (still under review by the app stores, but here’s a great tutorial) or HiveSigner (the new Hive version of Steemconnect). Both will be supported by hive.blog and PeakD.com has already integrated them, alongside their own PeakLock. Most apps and frontends have already begun work or do work with a key management solution like one of these. Remember that your witness votes from Steem will carry over to Hive. Whichever blockchain you use, votes are available. You are part of governance, so this is an excellent time to start fresh and discover all of the dedicated witnesses in both ecosystems. Many people worked hard to bring Hive to life, and some are witnesses. Please review your votes on Hive as often as you feel like, and vote according to what you want to see and to those you want to support. There are a huge amount of witnesses, from consensus (top twenty) to backup, and they should all be part of your considerations if you believe they are the right fit. Exchanges are working on getting up and running. Right now, Ionomy has full, limited time fee free trading enabled. The other exchanges listing Hive are already working on getting their trading pairs online. There are 6 more exchanges who are working on the airdrops, with some of them also working on a listing. However, these things do need to be done safely, and take a lot of behind the scenes tech support, so please note that this process can take a little while. The Hive is buzzing, and that’s thanks to people like YOU. The spirit and energy around the chain are invigorating…. make this a time to start fresh and spread your wings. EDIT: our fumble fingered worker bee needed to refresh the post while making it and was so excited they forgot to decline the rewards. These will be powered up so this account no longer needs delegation, and will continue to decline rewards in the future. Sorry! See: The Hive Blockchain Has Launched Successfully!

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-buzz-is-real-after-weeks-of-hard-teamwork-were-announcing-the-launch-of-the-new-hive-blockchain&quot;&gt;The buzz is real! &lt;strong&gt;After weeks of hard teamwork, we’re announcing the launch of the new Hive blockchain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting time, and an opportunity to channel the love and power of a resilient and tenacious community into collaborative development for the future of social blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hive is a passionate effort, created by a large group of Steem community members who have long looked to move towards true decentralization and to help develop the code base. The years of distribution issues and reliance on a central entity for code and infrastructure has been at the heart of a revolution of sorts, and the new Hive blockchain is the culmination of stepping up to meet the challenge of returning to shared values of protecting and celebrating the vibrant community that has grown around our ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;check-out-the-faq-below-for-info-on-the-launch-of-hive&quot;&gt;Check out the FAQ below for info on the launch of Hive.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-hive-and-why-was-it-created&quot;&gt;What is Hive and why was it created?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hive is a DPOS governance blockchain created by implementing a hard fork of existing Steem code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intention of this community-driven fork is to support and build on the strong Steem community values that have made our ecosystem so diverse and exciting. This new direction steps away from the burden of the Steemit Inc. ninja-mined stake, which has impacted the long term ability to work towards further development and decentralization for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hive has begun with a talented and committed team of community developers who are already paving the way to implement much awaited improvements and robust new developments to the blockchain. It is exciting to see the community – from devs and business owners to passionate end users – stepping forward to embrace and contribute to the potential of Hive. This renewed spirit, combined with a renewed codebase and a focus on working more closely with the entire ecosystem, is key to the success and possibilities for the future of social blockchain.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-difference-between-hive-and-steem&quot;&gt;What is the difference between Hive and Steem?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hive is a fork of the Steem blockchain and runs completely independently from the existing chain.  All valid accounts on the Steem blockchain will receive an airdrop on Hive. &lt;em&gt;(more details below)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Hive chain is a fork of the Steem code, the intention is to take responsibility to build something even better. The initial Hive launch will be a direct copy of existing blockchain with a few small upgrades, which will allow us to get back to community discussion on the direction for future development, needed changes, and most wanted chain-level features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spirit of Steem and the goal of decentralization has always been to move away from a single point of authority, and to capitalize on and encourage the potential that has gathered in our community. Hive is drawing on the huge range of talent in our ecosystem to accelerate development, improve communication, and return to a focus on ease of use, onboarding, and marketing. The desire to move towards better decentralization and to connect people via blockchain has never been lost, and it’s what makes Hive so needed now.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-happens-when-hive-launches&quot;&gt;What happens when Hive launches?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When The Hive blockchain launches, existing Steem accounts will appear on the Hive Network as well. You will have two accounts: the current one on the Steem, and a new Hive account, which will be pre-populated with all of your current Steem content and information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of these two accounts will be the same, but from the snapshot point onward, the accounts will be independent from one another. Actions you take on one network will not be reflected on the other. This means that future content and transactions will belong to whichever account you use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;if-you-post-on-hive-it-will-not-show-up-on-steem-and-vice-versa-the-two-chains-will-be-completely-independent-of-one-another-after-launch&quot;&gt;If you post on Hive, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;it will not show up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on Steem, and vice versa. The two chains will be completely independent of one another after launch.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-will-hive-launch&quot;&gt;When will Hive launch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hive blockchain launch will be at 10am EST/14:00 UTC, Friday, March 20th.&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;em&gt;countdown at https://hive.io/&lt;/em&gt;) All of the magic will happen this week! The snapshot and airdrop will take place back to back at the time of launch. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-can-i-find-hives-code&quot;&gt;Where can I find Hive’s code?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the public open source repo for Hive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;httpsgithubcomopenhive-networkhivereleases&quot;&gt;https://github.com/openhive-network/hive/releases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;as-a-steem--holder-what-do-i-get-in-the-hive-airdrop&quot;&gt;As a STEEM  holder, what do I get in the Hive airdrop?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All valid STEEM stakeholders will receive a perfectly mirrored balance of their current STEEM holdings in the new HIVE coin. This will include matching amounts of current liquid STEEM, Steem Power, and SBD. All other account state data, such as claimed accounts, delegations, etc. will be mirrored onto Hive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: if your Steem account has 10 STEEM, 5 SBD, and 1000 SP, your new Hive account will have 10 HIVE, 5 HBD, and 1000 HP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will not need to claim anything.&lt;/strong&gt; Simply log in with your existing Steem account details and you will have your new HIVE coins in your wallet and be able to start using the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-hive-airdrop-will-only-be-performed-on-the-current-version-of-the-steem-blockchain-as-of-the-date-of-this-post-any-emergency-hardforks-performed-prior-to-the-airdrop-will-not-be-eligible-further-any-exchange-that-participates-in-such-a-hardfork-prior-to-the-airdrop-date-will-null-and-void-the-ability-to-participate-in-the-airdrop-for-its-off-chain-balance-holding-customers&quot;&gt;The Hive airdrop will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be performed on the current version of the Steem blockchain (as of the date of this post). Any “emergency hardforks” performed prior to the airdrop will not be eligible. Further, any exchange that participates in such a hardfork prior to the airdrop date will null and void the ability to participate in the airdrop for its off-chain balance holding customers.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-access-my-hive-account-to-post-content-and-send-hive-coins&quot;&gt;How do I access my Hive account to post content and send Hive coins?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access your Hive account by simply logging in on the Hive Network using your existing Steem account keys. The first frontend available will be https://hive.blog. This is currently pointed at the Steem blockchain, but will be switched to Hive at launch time. Other popular interfaces are completing the switch over to Hive or finishing new products, and will be announcing when they are ready to use!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-is-behind-the-development-of-hive&quot;&gt;Who is behind the development of Hive?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently over 30 experienced developers contributing to the new ecosystem, alongside many committed community members working on multiple aspects of Hive. These individuals may announce their participation through their own accounts in the future. This a true community effort, and therefore is open to all. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hive will remain open source, and open to everyone who wants to contribute to the future development of the blockchain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Testnet will be available after this post is published, so feel free to comment here if you would like to access and we’ll reach out. The full codebase will move to a public repo on Thursday, March 19th, prior to launch. &lt;em&gt;Updates will be made to this post and via this account.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-improvements-have-been-added&quot;&gt;What improvements have been added?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important improvements and decisions will be made after initial launch with a chance for proper feedback from the community. To successfully launch, there are some aspects that needed to be addressed immediately, including prevention of exchanges from participating in governance attacks (as we witnessed on the Steem Blockchain).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent governance (or funding) attacks, a 30 day delay has been added on crediting vests towards witness and SPS votes. Further governance changes will need to be developed alongside the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This delay means that after an account “powers up” or stakes funds, there will be a 30 day delay before those vests can be used towards voting on governance (witnesses) or through voting in the SPS. For all other actions, there is no delay and vests are immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an initial way for us to mitigate this risk while continuing to improve the system as a whole, and without deciding on governance changes before returning to collection of wider community input. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;will-all-steem-accounts-be-included-in-the-hive-airdrop&quot;&gt;Will all Steem accounts be included in the HIVE airdrop?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of Hive is to continue moving towards true decentralization, and therefore the launch airdrop will include all accounts who have showcased these same values and shared goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only accounts who will not be included in the initial airdrop are those containing the Steemit Inc ninja-mined stake, and those who actively contributed to (and publicly declared support for) the centralization of the Steem Blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These accounts can still choose to take part in the new chain and their accounts will exist, but they will not be included in the intial airdrop.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YES&lt;/strong&gt;) If you DO want to participate in the airdrop, please notify the Hive team that your exchange will distribute the airdrop on a pro-rata basis to your Steem customers (no fixed timeline for distribution is required), and the Hive account that corresponds to your Steem account will receive the airdrop at the time of the launch of Hive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NO&lt;/strong&gt;) If you DO NOT want to participate in the airdrop, please send out a notification to your Steem-holding users to forewarn them that you will not be participating, so that they can temporarily withdraw their Steem from your exchange before the airdrop snapshot date, if they wish to participate in the Hive airdrop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If at all possible, please let us know by &lt;strong&gt;Thursday, March 19&lt;/strong&gt; if you will or will not be participating in the airdrop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can notify us by leaving a message on this post using your official Steem account, or you can contact one of our exchange liaisons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gandalf (located in Europe)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;telegram&lt;/em&gt;: @Gandalf_the_Grey
&lt;em&gt;email&lt;/em&gt;: gandalf@hive.expert&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Jefferys (located in US)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;telegram&lt;/em&gt;: @djefferys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Direct follow-ups will be made, but if we do not receive an affirmative response by days end Thursday, March 19th, we will assume that your exchange doesn’t wish to participate in the airdrop for holding customer balances.&lt;/p&gt;
