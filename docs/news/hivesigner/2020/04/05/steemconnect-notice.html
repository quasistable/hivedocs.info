It has been incredible few years serving all users and dapps on Steem, but now that we have migrated to Hive as Hivesigner. It is time to focus our time and effort making Hivesigner the best authentication service, it can be on Hive. Sunset date We are setting a date to stop SteemConnect services on 1st June, 2020. We kindly request all Dapp developers to plan and inform their users about changes. Migration options We will actively be improving Hivesigner and encourage developers to build on Hive. But if for some reason you want to stay on Steem, please migrate to some other fork of SteemConnect - for example SteemLogin. We are not in any way connected with any forks, as always do your own research, audit and security of new forks. Hivesigner development For all new developers, visitors, SteemConnect will be redirecting everyone to Hivesigner homepage and help them get started with development on Hive. We will be adding FAQ and more detailed documentation on How to integrate Hivesigner to your website, How to authenticate with Hivesigner extension, How to sign transactions securely, etc. We have published roadmap and proposal to support continuous development of the project. Please read more about it here and support our effort bringing secure and social authentication to the masses.
