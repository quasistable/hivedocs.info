We do not intend to submit another proposal on Steem as we do not plan to continue to work on the Steem Keychain extension, so funding going forward will only come from Hive. We greatly appreciate the support from everyone who has backed the proposal, and we hope that the community will vote to continue the funding when the initial proposal expires.
