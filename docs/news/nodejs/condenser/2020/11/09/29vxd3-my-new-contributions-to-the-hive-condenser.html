The recent addition of Peakd and Hivebuzz social and achievement badges stirred some controversy, some people loved it, some hated it and requested for its removal or at least for a way to opt-out.

I initially thought of refactoring the look and feel of the badges bar on the user profile header and add a new user preferences but after discussing with other members of the dev team we agreed on implementing @guiltyparties' suggestion:
 - rename "Communities" tab to "Social" as it was pretty empty.
 - move the badges from the header into the "Social" tab.

## Bandcamp and Archive.org embedded players
I think I forgot to mention in previous update that there is a pending merge request for embedded players for Bandcamp and Archive.org.

Merge request on GitLab: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/condenser/-/merge_requests/137

## Notes
- Both features are still pending review, tests and deployment from the dev team.
- As for now, it is decided to slow down on addition of new embedded players since we have covered main ones already and would like to focus on other more important features and bug fixes.
