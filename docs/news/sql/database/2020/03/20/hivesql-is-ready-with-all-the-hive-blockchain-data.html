<p>The Hive blockchain is alive! Congratulations to all the hard workers who lately have been working night and day to make our beloved blockchain decentralized again.</p>

<p>I am happy to announce that HiveSQL, a publicly available SQL database with all the blockchain data, is now available, in synch with the Hive blockchain and ready to support the many (d)Apps and analysts that rely on it.</p>

<h3 id="better-performances-and-ready-for-the-future">Better performances and ready for the future</h3>

<p>Icing on the cake, HiveSQL benefits from a whole new infrastructure that is even more efficient. Memory and storage capacity have been <strong>doubled</strong> and computing capacity has also been increased.</p>

<p>HiveSQL is now ready to face the future and the most demanding users!</p>

<h3 id="what-about-steemsql">What about SteemSQL?</h3>

<p>SteemSQL will continue to run at least until the end of the month, longer if active subscriptions cover the costs of its infrastructure. This will allow those who wish to see what is going on in the old Steem world.</p>
