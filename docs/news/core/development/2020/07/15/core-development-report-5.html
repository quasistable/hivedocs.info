<meta name="description" content="![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/howo/ArVTsoCi-image.png) Hey guys! Sorry for the lack of reports lately, with hf24 (codename: eclipse) drawing near, my workload has increased significantly, so I didn&#39;t have the time to make reports, but here I am ! The bulk of my work has been reading on what blocktrades&#39; team has been doing, they did a monster commit where pretty much the whole codebase changed (everything related to steem was renamed for hive) I also organized a few dev meetings in which we discussed a lot of technical details, you can find them on my profile here and there, the latest edition is there: https://peakd.com/hive/@howo/hive-core-developper-meeting-6 I started to take notes during those meetings to make summaries in the post, I feel like not everyone wants to listen through 45-60 minutes long meetings where they don&#39;t understand everything. Meanwhile I also worked on the ninja mine conversion feature, after making a public debate to get some of the public&#39;s thoughts on how long that process should take: https://peakd.com/hive-102930/@howo/public-debate-at-which-rate-should-the-non-airdropped-stake-be-converted-to-hbd I finished the feature (netuoso and I worked on it a while ago) as it wasn&#39;t ready to work with sub 1% amounts. I also changed the code to make it work daily instead of hourly, which required some changes at the chain level to have a &quot;daily actions&quot; processor that would trigger once per day. Reason that if we want to process daily instead of hourly is that there isn&#39;t really a need for it to happen every hour. I also tested the feature thourougly with various amount to see how it worked. I also changed the way the debt ratio is calculated to not include HBD inside of the dhf, the reason behind it is that it doesn&#39;t really make sense to have the debt ratio calculated on funds that are currently locked, they should be taken into account when they are &quot;liquid&quot; aka paid out to people. This is especially important because there will be an important influx of hbd to the dhf as we convert the ninja mine. Nowadays, apart from testing, I am working on some more renaming changes: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/issues/61, basically some files still have &quot;sps&quot; linked to it, which we do no want. That&#39;s about it for this update, see you soon ! @howo See: Core development report #5 by @howo" />

Hey guys!

Sorry for the lack of reports lately, with hf24 (codename: eclipse) drawing near, my workload has increased significantly, so I didn't have the time to make reports, but here I am !

The bulk of my work has been reading on what blocktrades' team has been doing, they did a monster commit where pretty much the whole codebase changed (everything related to steem was renamed for hive)

I also organized a few dev meetings in which we discussed a lot of technical details, you can find them on my profile here and there, the latest edition is there: https://peakd.com/hive/@howo/hive-core-developper-meeting-6
I started to take notes during those meetings to make summaries in the post, I feel like not everyone wants to listen through 45-60 minutes long meetings where they don't understand everything.

Meanwhile I also worked on the ninja mine conversion feature, after making a public debate to get some of the public's thoughts on how long that process should take: https://peakd.com/hive-102930/@howo/public-debate-at-which-rate-should-the-non-airdropped-stake-be-converted-to-hbd

I finished the feature (netuoso and I worked on it a while ago) as it wasn't ready to work with sub 1% amounts. I also changed the code to make it work daily instead of hourly, which required some changes at the chain level to have a "daily actions" processor that would trigger once per day. Reason that if we want to process daily instead of hourly is that there isn't really a need for it to happen every hour. I also tested the feature thourougly with various amount to see how it worked. 

I also changed the way the debt ratio is calculated to not include HBD inside of the dhf, the reason behind it is that it doesn't really make sense to have the debt ratio calculated on funds that are currently locked, they should be taken into account when they are "liquid" aka paid out to people. 

This is especially important because there will be an important influx of hbd to the dhf as we convert the ninja mine.

Nowadays, apart from testing, I am working on some more renaming changes: https://gitlab.syncad.com/hive/hive/-/issues/61, basically some files still have "sps" linked to it, which we do no want.

That's about it for this update, see you soon !
