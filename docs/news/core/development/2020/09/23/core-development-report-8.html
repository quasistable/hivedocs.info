<meta name="description" content="![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/howo/6ZzMfzKf-image.png) Hello ! It&#39;s been while since I&#39;ve done one of those, so I figured I&#39;d do one. It&#39;s rather short because there isn&#39;t much to talk about. I finished testing hf24 and I am now working to get the RC delegation feature to work again. You might remember me saying that the feature was ready, well the issue is that a lot of the code around it has changed (rebranding and optimization from @blocktrades&#39; team) so I need to adapt my pull request to work with them and also follow the rebranding (I had to remove a lot of &quot;steem&quot; here and there). And it&#39;s not an easy process as I&#39;m not too familiar with some of the changes. One fun tidbit I noticed today is one of the devs leaving a message for devs like me: ![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/howo/f0nAsrXI-image.png) Basically some things used to be accessible and now they aren&#39;t so you need to code some things differently (it&#39;s not a bad thing). Anyways, work is underway, I have decided to leave the original merge request intact while I work to get the feature to work again because I am changing a lot of things and I want to keep somewhere a branch with the code that works on hf23 in case I delete some code by mistake. The gitlab is currently unavailable so I can&#39;t link the branch I&#39;m working on to you, but as soon as it is, feel freel to check it out, the name is `feature/rc_delegation_rebase` Howo See: Core development report #8 by @howo" />

Hello ! 

It's been while since I've done one of those, so I figured I'd do one. It's rather short because there isn't much to talk about.  I finished testing hf24 and I am now working to get the RC delegation feature to work again.

You might remember me saying that the feature was ready, well the issue is that a lot of the code around it has changed (rebranding and optimization from @blocktrades' team) so I need to adapt my pull request to work with them and also follow the rebranding (I had to remove a lot of "steem" here and there). And it's not an easy process as I'm not too familiar with some of the changes. One fun tidbit I noticed today is one of the devs leaving a message for devs like me:

![image.png](https://files.peakd.com/file/peakd-hive/howo/f0nAsrXI-image.png)

Basically some things used to be accessible and now they aren't so you need to code some things differently (it's not a bad thing).

Anyways, work is underway, I have decided to leave the original merge request intact while I work to get the feature to work again because I am changing a lot of things and I want to keep somewhere a branch with the code that works on hf23 in case I delete some code by mistake.

 The gitlab is currently unavailable so I can't link the branch I'm working on to you, but as soon as it is, feel freel to check it out, the name is `feature/rc_delegation_rebase`
