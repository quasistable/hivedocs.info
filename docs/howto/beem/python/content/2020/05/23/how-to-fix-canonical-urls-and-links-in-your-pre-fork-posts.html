<meta name="description" content="As you can see here, I have some links in my blogs written before the hive-fork pointing to steemit.com. It&#39;s time to replace them all. ![steemit link in my blog](https://images.hive.blog/DQmfDpnHj9kXEqo2ZXNSAkaPbFb4svFqWXLyUEdEuniqd3e/steemit%20link%20in%20my%20blog) Almost all blog posts written before the fork are written with apps that are not included in [hivescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hivechain/hivescript) and lead to problems with canonical URLs: As it can be seen here, my old post [update for beem: first release for HF 21](https://peakd.com/beem/@holger80/update-for-beem-first-release-for-hf-21) result in different canonical URLs on different front-ends. This is then handled as duplicated content by the search engines. The post was written through palnet. As there is no entry for palnet in [hivescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hivechain/hivescript), the front-ends to not know how to build a proper canonical URL: ![wrong canonical url](https://images.hive.blog/DQmXe1t2QwJtizzVXDpG89GVNxyYAorFu6Tjj5LRnXkEJss/wrong%20canonical%20url) # Fixing The mess Fixing means: * replacing all steemit, steempeak, ... links with relative links * setting `canonical_url` for each post written before 2020-03-20, to fix canonical URLs. ### Small update The script uses now relative links, when found a link to steemit.com ..., it will be replaced by a relative link. A relative link looks like: `[holger80](/@holger80)` and `[this post](/hive-139531/@holger80/how-to-fix-canonical-urls-and-links-in-your-pre-fork-posts)` ### Small update 2 There are now three boolean parameters, which can be used to set the following: * `replace_steemit_links`: when True, steemit, ... links will be replaced * `use_relative_links`: when True, relative links will be used (starting with `/`) * `add_canonical_url`: When True, a canonical_url is added to the metadata ### Small update 3 It is now possible to use the same script for fixing the canonical links on STEEM for all written post before the fork. When you want to use the script on STEEM: * set `target_blockchain = &quot;steem&quot;` When you want to use the script on HIVE: * set `target_blockchain = &quot;hive&quot;` ### Python code The following script is using beem and will do exactly this. beem can be installed by ``` pip install beem ``` or ``` conda install beem ``` Store the following as `fix_canonical_urls_hive.py`: ``` #!/usr/bin/python from beem import Hive, Steem from beem.utils import addTzInfo from beem.account import Account from beem.comment import Comment from beem.nodelist import NodeList import time from datetime import datetime import getpass if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Parameter canonical_url = &quot;https://hive.blog&quot; replace_steemit_links = True use_relative_links = True add_canonical_url = True target_blockchain = &quot;hive&quot; # can be hive or steem # ---- # at least one option must be true assert replace_steemit_links or add_canonical_url assert target_blockchain in [&quot;hive&quot;, &quot;steem&quot;] # Canonical url must not end with / if canonical_url[-1] == &quot;/&quot;: canonical_url = canonical_url[:-1] nodelist = NodeList() nodelist.update_nodes() test_run_answer = input(&quot;Do a test run?

Whenever the post was written by an app, that is not properly handled by [hivescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hivechain/hivescript), a new canonical_url is set. You can define your preferred front-end here: ``` canonical_url = &quot;https://hive.blog&quot; ``` If you like other front-ends, you can replace this line by * `canonical_url = &quot;https://peakd.com&quot;` * `canonical_url = &quot;https://leofinance.io&quot;` * `canonical_url = &quot;https://esteem.app&quot;` In the next step, all used links are checked. Whenever a link is pointing to a valid hive post or to a valid hive user, the link is replaced by a releative url (When the link was pointing to steemit.com, steempeak.com, busy.org or partiko.app). ## Test run You can do a test run and checking what will be changed by the script: ![test_run](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZht6KJmnJkBGebgwyXdGBpj4dSCCYkdqwzn6PpwD4ado/test_run) This show now the following information: ![test result](https://images.hive.blog/DQmWE3JdvZBYJauzmAHjFFnsCwyuZ6YBHzonbbSbtPf5Gdx/test%20result) The set canonical url is shown as well all links that will be replaced. ## Fixing your posts We can now start to fix all old posts: ![starting the script](https://images.hive.blog/DQmdaFJFkxsAaMmc8wG5vESFwRGqPJwRR2GPXySJtvEAxKh/starting%20the%20script) ## Results All changes have been broadcasted: ![Broadcasted posts](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNq6JKN9Cr5mDkBMsEcL8nCqRvH7ktkprTNXTU75K4Pz4/Broadcasted%20posts) The links have been corrected, as shown here: ![](https://images.hive.blog/DQmUFVmj9vW84ZH1aa2V4PfSKHsJLsARDUkWbo62KpxnnfA/image) There seems to be a bug with hive.blog, that steemit.com links are shown as internal and hive.blog links are shown as external links. The canonical url is also fixed: ![canonical urls](https://images.hive.blog/DQmVjxuvCHYtfaS2p6c9i4wj43siJUMJciB2gwKE8dn5RMs/canonical%20urls) It seems that esteem.app has not changed its canonical url right now. As I know that esteem.app should read the `canonical_url` parameter (works for steempress), it may correct the canonical URLs later. After a fix on esteem.app, esteem.app is using now the correct canonical url: ![canonical url from esteem.app](https://images.hive.blog/DQmcbaPV3teUczT5WmxuaMybeyz4hdTEbaG5NV6kQ2HGHhj/canonical%20url%20from%20esteem.app) ## Results on STEEM Setting `canonical_url` works also on steemit: ![canonical url on steemit](https://images.hive.blog/DQmShxP35w4ARXfryjEdsdWnuVKV1zebkSoRgbGCjTQRQbC/canonical%20url%20on%20steemit) I used [seoreviewtools](https://www.seoreviewtools.com/canonical-url-location-checker/) to check the canonical urls. ___ *If you like what I do, consider casting a vote for me as witness on [Hivesigner](https://hivesigner.com/sign/account-witness-vote?witness=holger80&amp;approve=1) or on [PeakD](https://peakd.com/witnesses)* See: How to fix canonical URLs and links in your pre-fork posts by @holger80" />

When you want to use the script on STEEM: * set `target_blockchain = &quot;steem&quot;` When you want to use the script on HIVE: * set `target_blockchain = &quot;hive&quot;` ### Python code The following script is using beem and will do exactly this. beem can be installed by ``` pip install beem ``` or ``` conda install beem ``` Store the following as `fix_canonical_urls_hive.py`: ``` #!/usr/bin/python from beem import Hive, Steem from beem.utils import addTzInfo from beem.account import Account from beem.comment import Comment from beem.nodelist import NodeList import time from datetime import datetime import getpass if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;: # Parameter canonical_url = &quot;https://hive.blog&quot; replace_steemit_links = True use_relative_links = True add_canonical_url = True target_blockchain = &quot;hive&quot; # can be hive or steem # ---- # at least one option must be true assert replace_steemit_links or add_canonical_url assert target_blockchain in [&quot;hive&quot;, &quot;steem&quot;] # Canonical url must not end with / if canonical_url[-1] == &quot;/&quot;: canonical_url = canonical_url[:-1] nodelist = NodeList() nodelist.update_nodes() test_run_answer = input(&quot;Do a test run?

Whenever the post was written by an app, that is not properly handled by [hivescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hivechain/hivescript), a new canonical_url is set. You can define your preferred front-end here: ``` canonical_url = &quot;https://hive.blog&quot; ``` If you like other front-ends, you can replace this line by * `canonical_url = &quot;https://peakd.com&quot;` * `canonical_url = &quot;https://leofinance.io&quot;` * `canonical_url = &quot;https://esteem.app&quot;` In the next step, all used links are checked. Whenever a link is pointing to a valid hive post or to a valid hive user, the link is replaced by a releative url (When the link was pointing to steemit.com, steempeak.com, busy.org or partiko.app). ## Test run You can do a test run and checking what will be changed by the script: ![test_run](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZht6KJmnJkBGebgwyXdGBpj4dSCCYkdqwzn6PpwD4ado/test_run) This show now the following information: ![test result](https://images.hive.blog/DQmWE3JdvZBYJauzmAHjFFnsCwyuZ6YBHzonbbSbtPf5Gdx/test%20result) The set canonical url is shown as well all links that will be replaced. ## Fixing your posts We can now start to fix all old posts: ![starting the script](https://images.hive.blog/DQmdaFJFkxsAaMmc8wG5vESFwRGqPJwRR2GPXySJtvEAxKh/starting%20the%20script) ## Results All changes have been broadcasted: ![Broadcasted posts](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNq6JKN9Cr5mDkBMsEcL8nCqRvH7ktkprTNXTU75K4Pz4/Broadcasted%20posts) The links have been corrected, as shown here: ![](https://images.hive.blog/DQmUFVmj9vW84ZH1aa2V4PfSKHsJLsARDUkWbo62KpxnnfA/image) There seems to be a bug with hive.blog, that steemit.com links are shown as internal and hive.blog links are shown as external links. The canonical url is also fixed: ![canonical urls](https://images.hive.blog/DQmVjxuvCHYtfaS2p6c9i4wj43siJUMJciB2gwKE8dn5RMs/canonical%20urls) It seems that esteem.app has not changed its canonical url right now. As I know that esteem.app should read the `canonical_url` parameter (works for steempress), it may correct the canonical URLs later. After a fix on esteem.app, esteem.app is using now the correct canonical url: ![canonical url from esteem.app](https://images.hive.blog/DQmcbaPV3teUczT5WmxuaMybeyz4hdTEbaG5NV6kQ2HGHhj/canonical%20url%20from%20esteem.app) ## Results on STEEM Setting `canonical_url` works also on steemit: ![canonical url on steemit](https://images.hive.blog/DQmShxP35w4ARXfryjEdsdWnuVKV1zebkSoRgbGCjTQRQbC/canonical%20url%20on%20steemit) I used [seoreviewtools](https://www.seoreviewtools.com/canonical-url-location-checker/) to check the canonical urls. ___ *If you like what I do, consider casting a vote for me as witness on [Hivesigner](https://hivesigner.com/sign/account-witness-vote?witness=holger80&amp;approve=1) or on [PeakD](https://peakd.com/witnesses)* See: How to fix canonical URLs and links in your pre-fork posts by @holger80","image":"https://images.hive.blog/DQmfDpnHj9kXEqo2ZXNSAkaPbFb4svFqWXLyUEdEuniqd3e/steemit%20link%20in%20my%20blog","headline":"How to fix canonical URLs and links in your pre-fork posts","dateModified":"2020-05-23T07:20:12-07:00","datePublished":"2020-05-23T07:20:12-07:00","url":"https://hive.blog/hive-139531/@holger80/how-to-fix-canonical-urls-and-links-in-your-pre-fork-posts","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"holger80"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://hive.blog/hive-139531/@holger80/how-to-fix-canonical-urls-and-links-in-your-pre-fork-posts"},"@type":"BlogPosting","@context":"https://schema.org"}</script>

As you can see here, I have some links in my blogs written before the hive-fork pointing to steemit.com. It's time to replace them all.

![steemit link in my blog](https://images.hive.blog/DQmfDpnHj9kXEqo2ZXNSAkaPbFb4svFqWXLyUEdEuniqd3e/steemit%20link%20in%20my%20blog)

Almost all blog posts written before the fork are written with apps that are not included in [hivescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hivechain/hivescript) and lead to problems with canonical URLs:

As it can be seen here, my old post [update for beem: first release for HF 21](https://peakd.com/beem/@holger80/update-for-beem-first-release-for-hf-21) result in different canonical URLs on different front-ends. This is then handled as duplicated content by the search engines.
The post was written through palnet. As there is no entry for palnet in [hivescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hivechain/hivescript), the front-ends to not know how to build a proper canonical URL:
![wrong canonical url](https://images.hive.blog/DQmXe1t2QwJtizzVXDpG89GVNxyYAorFu6Tjj5LRnXkEJss/wrong%20canonical%20url)

# Fixing The mess
Fixing means:

* replacing all steemit, steempeak, ... links with relative links
* setting `canonical_url` for each post written before 2020-03-20, to fix canonical  URLs.

### Small update
The script uses now relative links, when found a link to steemit.com ..., it will be replaced by a relative link. A relative link looks like: `[holger80](/@holger80)` and `[this post](/hive-139531/@holger80/how-to-fix-canonical-urls-and-links-in-your-pre-fork-posts)`

### Small update 2
There are now three boolean parameters, which can be used to set the following:

* `replace_steemit_links`: when True, steemit, ... links will be replaced
* `use_relative_links`: when True, relative links will be used (starting with `/`)
* `add_canonical_url`: When True, a canonical_url is added to the metadata

### Small update 3
It is now possible to use the same script for fixing the canonical links on STEEM for all written post before the fork.
When you want to use the script on STEEM:
* set `target_blockchain = "steem"`

When you want to use the script on HIVE:
* set `target_blockchain = "hive"`

### Python code
The following script is using beem and will do exactly this.

beem can be installed by
```
pip install beem
```
or
```
conda install beem
```

Store the following as `fix_canonical_urls_hive.py`:

```
#!/usr/bin/python

        expected_count += 100
    
    
```

You can now start the script with:
```
python fix_canonical_urls_hive.py
```
If you are on Linux, you should replace `pip` by `pip3` and `python` by `python3`.

## How does it work
The script goes through all blog posts written before 2020-03-14. Whenever the post was written by an app, that is not properly handled by [hivescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hivechain/hivescript), a new canonical_url is set.

You can define your preferred front-end here:
```
canonical_url = "https://hive.blog"
```
If you like other front-ends, you can replace this line by
* `canonical_url = "https://peakd.com"`
* `canonical_url = "https://leofinance.io"`
* `canonical_url = "https://esteem.app"`

In the next step, all used links are checked. Whenever a link is pointing to a valid hive post or to a valid hive user, the link is replaced by a releative url (When the link was pointing to steemit.com, steempeak.com, busy.org or partiko.app).

## Test run
You can do a test run and checking what will be changed by the script:
![test_run](https://images.hive.blog/DQmZht6KJmnJkBGebgwyXdGBpj4dSCCYkdqwzn6PpwD4ado/test_run)

This show now the following information:

![test result](https://images.hive.blog/DQmWE3JdvZBYJauzmAHjFFnsCwyuZ6YBHzonbbSbtPf5Gdx/test%20result)
The set canonical url is shown as well all links that will be replaced.

## Fixing your posts
We can now start to fix all old posts:
![starting the script](https://images.hive.blog/DQmdaFJFkxsAaMmc8wG5vESFwRGqPJwRR2GPXySJtvEAxKh/starting%20the%20script)

## Results
All changes have been broadcasted:
![Broadcasted posts](https://images.hive.blog/DQmNq6JKN9Cr5mDkBMsEcL8nCqRvH7ktkprTNXTU75K4Pz4/Broadcasted%20posts)

The links have been corrected, as shown here:
![](https://images.hive.blog/DQmUFVmj9vW84ZH1aa2V4PfSKHsJLsARDUkWbo62KpxnnfA/image)
There seems to be a bug with hive.blog, that steemit.com links are shown as internal and hive.blog links are shown as external links.

The canonical url is also fixed:

![canonical urls](https://images.hive.blog/DQmVjxuvCHYtfaS2p6c9i4wj43siJUMJciB2gwKE8dn5RMs/canonical%20urls)

It seems that esteem.app has not changed its canonical url right now. As I know that esteem.app should read the `canonical_url` parameter (works for steempress), it may correct the canonical URLs later.

After a fix on esteem.app, esteem.app is using now the correct canonical url:
![canonical url from esteem.app](https://images.hive.blog/DQmcbaPV3teUczT5WmxuaMybeyz4hdTEbaG5NV6kQ2HGHhj/canonical%20url%20from%20esteem.app)

## Results on STEEM
Setting `canonical_url` works also on steemit:

![canonical url on steemit](https://images.hive.blog/DQmShxP35w4ARXfryjEdsdWnuVKV1zebkSoRgbGCjTQRQbC/canonical%20url%20on%20steemit)

I used [seoreviewtools](https://www.seoreviewtools.com/canonical-url-location-checker/) to check the canonical urls.
