<p><a href="https://github.com/holgern/beem">beem</a> is a python library for STEEM and HIVE.  The current version is 0.22.13.</p>

<p>There is also a discord channel for beem: 
<a href="https://discord.gg/4HM592V">https://discord.gg/4HM592V</a></p>

<p>The newest beem version can be installed by:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install -U beem

<p>Check that you are using hive nodes. The following command</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>beempy updatenodes --hive

<p>updates the nodelist and uses only hive nodes. The list of nodes can be checked with</p>

<p>and</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>beempy currentnode

<p>All integration tests are finishing now in</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>========== 469 passed, 27 skipped, 11 warnings in 1040.19s (0:17:20) ===========

<p>which is an improvement of 49% (version 0.22.12 needed 1551 seconds).</p>

<p>This huge boost could be accomplished by reducing the number of API calls when creating the Steem object. When importing objects from beem, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">configStorage</code> object is no longer created during import. The config storage is now read during object creation with <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_default_config_storage</code>. This speeds up importing beem modules and read stored parameter only when needed.</p>

<p>These changes improves also the speed of all beempy commands.</p>

<h2 id="bridge-api">Bridge API</h2>
<p>beem supports now parts of the bridge API. More functions to support the missing API calls will follow.</p>

<h3 id="notifications">notifications</h3>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>beempy notifications holger80

<h3 id="list-all-subscribtions">list all subscribtions</h3>
<p>The account object has now a <code class="highlighter-rouge">list_all_subscriptions</code> functions which returns   a list with all cummunities which the account has subscript.</p>

<h3 id="get_account_posts">get_account_posts</h3>
<p>The account object has now the <code class="highlighter-rouge">get_account_posts</code> function, which can be used to fetch all posts shown in the feed of the account.</p>

<h3 id="get_ranked_posts">get_ranked_posts</h3>
<p>A new class <code class="highlighter-rouge">RankedPosts</code> was added to <code class="highlighter-rouge">beem.comment</code> which can be used to receive ranked posts.</p>

<h2 id="change-recovery-account-with-beempy">Change recovery account with beempy</h2>
<p>It is now possible to change the recovery account using beempy</p>

<h2 id="hivesigner-support-was-added">HiveSigner support was added</h2>
<p>The following python example shows how to create a login link:</p>

hivesigner = HiveSigner(client_id="rewarding.app", scope="login", get_refresh_token=False)

<p>returns</p>
