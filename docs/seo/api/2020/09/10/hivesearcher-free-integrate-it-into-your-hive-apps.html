<center>![hivesearcher-decentralized-search-engine-hive-ecency](https://images.esteem.app/DQmcAKfEJdgj55sTB3gWTVMzw6WtZ5K9V3uwbH83DA9a8QM/thumbnail.png)</center>

## API endpoint change

We have changed our API endpoint, it is now https://api.hivesearcher.com. Old api endpoint will continue to function until we deprecate it later, but we urge you to change or use new endpoint. Try it out and let us know if you find some issues.

## Documentation

Made relevant changes to API documentation: https://hivesearcher.com/api-docs as well as obtaining API key screen. From now on it is completely free to integrate search into your app. Visit above page and get your API key. There is daily 3k requests limit by default and if there is need for increase, just ping us and we will make sure to increase it.

## API keys

Existing API keys are updated to non-expiry token, so if you have paid previously for keys, those are updated to freemium automatically.

## Cluster improvements

We have made some improvements on servers to get us ready for upcoming ranking, indexing changes. Any new change in ranking algorithm will require couple days and demanding memory/disk sizes, so in coming days we will write about existing ranking algorithms and how we are proposing to improve it.

## Next

Our next course of actions will be to check ranking algorithm, remove payout factoring from Popular filter and improve UI of hivesearcher.com so user can have better, simpler filtering options. Similar to Google search tools which everyone is familiar with. Another thing, we need to check and make sure any new changes on `hivemind` with upcoming Hardfork doesn't break `hive2elastic` plugin. 

## Call for Hive apps

Are you developer of Hive apps? Check Search engine and consider adding it into your app for better, fast content search. Any tribes, mobile app, website frontends, desktop app using hive content could potentially integrate search feature in couple lines of code. 

Go to https://hivesearcher.com/api-docs and click on `GET YOUR API KEY` button, confirm your Hive account with Hivesigner (it doesn't require any authority, we use Hivesigner just to validate username). That's it, make sure your API key backed up and stays private, not published in public repositories.
