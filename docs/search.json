before go into my normal reporting the detailed coding issues that blocktrades team worked last week and our plans for upcoming week, first wanted give brief overview of hardfork process it happened since that’s what’s been driving work flow in past week.# review 24 (and an “unplanned” that)on date (oct 14th), apps developers were still making related changes api problems they finding with hivemind, while was working fixing those bugs reported (i’ll discuss bug fixes later post). meanwhile, top 20 witnesses standing by, waiting “all clear” signal enough stable we could safely execute by upgrading their nodes code (tagged hived node repository either v1.24.2 or v1.24.3).several had already updated code, but considered ok me other devs, hf24 requires super-majority switch trigger new protocol contains. allowed some not have hang around waited apps/hivemind integration get acceptable level triggered hardfork.unfortunately, led unexpected side-effect: contained change wasn’t properly guarded against execution 24. means produce block wouldn’t accepted hf23 nodes. never seen before, because only cause problem when produced then under special circumstances. there few times prior we’ve run producing node, past, such minority, so worst thing might if got would temporarily fork, fall back consensus chain generated nodes.but date, even though didn’t running hf24, did majority hf24. is do determine how forks resolved. one rejected nodes, fork resolution logic kept separate unplanned hard from (effectively splitting two forks). quickly realized what happening, decided remaining all rejoined fork. also required operators upgrade hive switched versions use nodes.because executed sooner than liked due split, hadn’t resolved performance hivemind at time

      "content"  : "![](https://i.imgur.com/yciuiaf.png)**i want to elaborate not only on introduced features but also my thought and reasoning so everyone can benefit introduce changes in their projects. this post will be long i believe it might useful for the entire hivedevs community.**the workflow is built top of gitlab ci/cd easily modified any other tool (i.e. circleci or jenkins).# dockeri've started work by reviewing `dockerfile`. i've `condenser` image was a bit shocked:```$ docker lscondenser latest 6d57c0c8a904 19 seconds ago 1.54gb```1.54 gb simple frontend application? boy, it's just too much. let's do something with it.## leaner imagelet's start recognizing reason why big. you look into your `dockerfile` `package.json` search some common mistakes: * using full-sized images rather than `alpine` versions installing dev dependencies production putting list copying useless files final imageyep, check every point here. make new dockerfile:```dockerfilefrom node:12.16.2 as developmentworkdir /var/appcopy package.json yarn.lock ./run yarn install --non-interactive --frozen-lockfile --ignore-optionalcopy . .run mkdir tmp &amp;&amp; buildcmd [ yarn, run,

/var/app/healthcheck.jshealthcheck --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=30s --retries=5 cmd node /var/app/healthcheck.jscmd ]```what has been improved: node.js version upgraded from `8.7` `12.16.2` which lts at moment. always try framework versions, may include security fixes performance upgrades. good habit use specific up `patch` number. multistage used an optimal deployment. first, we `development` stage dependency able compile react application. next, we're removing `--production` switch during `dependencies` stage. after all, creating minimal smallest base available, necessary directories. healthcheck introduced, daemon manage containers automatic restarts if zero-downtime deployments explained later post. dynamic scaling capabilities `docker swarm`.also, file modified, worth its content here: like `webpack`, `babel` `eslint` moved proper called `devdependencies` `yarn` could deps image. strict were sure produces exactly same semantic versioning popular, there no way package author does breaking increased. need update package, manually. have enough test coverage, run everything works fine.after all that done, condenser size massively reduced:```$ 58406d338e67 8 226mb```![](https://i.imgur.com/xgtpxcq.png)![](https://i.imgur.com/accocud.png)the compressed registry even smaller. much better, right? shame you, steemit!## healthchecksimply speaking, running trying keep alive possible. system needs determine container `actually alive`. seem alive, app responding requests example? fortunately, integrated health mechanism `docker-compose.yml`. usually, create endpoint liveness checks. already one utilize easily.there lot examples `curl` check, go. should cross-platform implementation differs windows unix. write technology projects are written, node.js.```javascriptconst http = require(http);const options { host: localhost, port: 8080, path: '/.well-known/healthcheck.json', timeout: 5000};const request http.request(options, (res) =&gt; console.log(`status: ${res.statuscode}`); (res.statuscode == 200) process.exit(0); } else console.error(`error: process.exit(1); }});request.on('error', (err) console.error('error', err); process.exit(1);});request.end();```when ready, instruct mechanism. add following line `dockefile`:`healthcheck /var/app/healthcheck.js`make `/var/app/healthcheck.js` exists inside working, inspect it:```$ lscontainer id command created status ports names060166cf52ee hiveio/condenser:development docker-entrypoint.s… 5 minutes (healthy) 0.0.0.0:8080-&gt;8080/tcp mystifying_dhawan```there `(healthy)` indicator `status` column. is. please note startup process, indicate slightly different (`starting`), wait before making first check. because giving time our startup. `start-period` parameter.depending traffic/load, those parameters vary.## pushing hubwe improved (smaller) image, push repository. doing manually waste cause human mistakes. best runner us bullet-proof manner.here `job` definition `.gitlab-ci.yml` additional code breakdown:```yamlvariables: docker_image: hiveio/condenser.docker-job: &amp;docker-job image: docker:stable services: - docker:dind before_script: echo $hub_token | login -u $hub_username --password-stdinbuild-development: &lt;&lt;: *docker-job stage: variables: docker_tag: $docker_image:$ci_commit_short_sha docker_tag_main: $docker_image:development source_commit: $ci_commit_sha only: develop script: -t $docker_tag $docker_tag_main --build-arg $docker_tag_main```first, global variable `docker_image` reuse many places. case would change name, single place.hence multiple `jobs` defined file, advanced yaml syntax, includes **hidden keys** **anchors**. decrease duplicated easier read maintain. job name starting dot considered hidden key **won't directly executed**. btw, quick temporarily disable without commenting it. `.docker-job: &amp;docker-job` anchor extend job. `&lt;&lt;: *docker-job`, populate `image`, `services` `before_script` properties automatically. move jobs similar things.later on, local (job scoped) `docker_tag_main` evaluated `hiveio/condenser:development` `docker_tag` `hiveio/condenser:344e55ef` `source_commit` `344e55efefd56e00b15eea6ccf8560a1107b9ff6` (or commit sha)it's idea double tag `latest` track process. describe how specific, `sha`-tagged rollback them anytime click.finally, building arguments `--build-arg`:`docker .`if scroll dockerfile section, notice `arg source_commit` `env ${source_commit}` means these injected environment variables containers. easy pass additional, build-level images. returned endpoint. instance source.```shell$ curl
